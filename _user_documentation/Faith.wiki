Like in Vanilla CK3, there's a group ecumenism doctrines, which makes faiths sharing that doctrine Righteous with each other, called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed ''Creeds'']. The ''Chalcedonian&#160;Creed'' and the ''Miaphysite&#160;Creed'' consider each other astray; no other creed modifies hostility to faiths of different creeds.

In 476, there are the following creeds:

<!-- NB: forcibly insert space to prevent regex matching here -->
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedonian_Definition Chalcedonian&nbsp;Creed]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miaphysitism Miaphysite&nbsp;Creed]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_East Eastern&nbsp;Creed]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arian_creeds Arian&nbsp;Creed]

Each Christian faith has six different ''Christian Doctrines'', which outline the faith's positions on various matters specific to Christianity, which were actively debated during Late Antiquity and the Migration Period. These include:

* Christian Doctrines
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christology Christology]
** Divine Onotlogy (e.g., [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity Trinitarianism] vs. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontrinitarianism Nontrinitarianism])
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatology Pneumatology]
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist Communion]
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteriology Soteriology]
** Judaic Role (e.g., [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersessionism Supersessionism] vs. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaizers Judaizers])
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy Liturgical Rite]

Because of the large number of Christian faiths, we have taken the liberty of grouping them together into General "Groups" of faiths with ''roughly'' similar Christian doctrines. This has no game effect and is merely a sorting artifact/historical curiousity.

<!--pandoc currently doesn't support mediawiki row/col spans, so we repeat definitions for our own parser-->

Like in Vanilla CK3, there's a group ecumenism doctines, which makes faiths sharing that doctrine Righteous with each other, called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed ''Creeds'']. The ''Chalcedonian Creed'' and the ''Miaphysite Creed'' consider each other astray; no other creed modifies hostility to faiths of different creeds.

In 476, there are the following creeds:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedonian_Definition Chalcedonian Creed]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miaphysitism Miaphysite Creed]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_East Eastern Creed]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arian_creeds Arian Creed]

Each Christian faith has six different ''Christian Doctrines'', which outline the faith's positions on various matters specific to Christianity, which were actively debated during Late Antiquity and the Migration Period. These include:

* Christian Doctrines
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christology Christology]
** Divine Onotlogy (e.g., [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity Trinitarianism] vs. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontrinitarianism Nontrinitarianism])
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatology Pneumatology]
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist Communion]
** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteriology Soteriology]
** Judaic Role (e.g., [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersessionism Supersessionism] vs. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaizers Judaizers])

Because of the large number of Christian faiths, we have taken the liberty of grouping them together into General "Groups" of faiths with ''roughly'' similar Christian doctrines. This has no game effect and is merely a sorting artifact.

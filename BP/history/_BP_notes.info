Turkic/Arab succession laws needed for arab titles

Possiblities: 
Greco-Afghan culture hybrid in Kandhar (c_rukhaj). Was attested to as late as 100 AD by Isadore of Charax

ETHOGENSIS ASSUMPTIONS:
Presumed origins of the Kurds are the various tribes around Mount Zagros

EVEN MORE BUDDHISM NOTES:
Notes: Faxian's route through north afghanistan seems to indicate a mix of Dharmaguptaka,
Mahayana, and Sarvastivada schools in Tarim region.

Mahayana seemed to explode in the 4th and 5th centuries, with only a few centers like c_mathura (in k_delhi) and
and Bamiyan (in k_bactria) before the 4th century. Ganhdara and Southern regions therefore should be Dharmaguptakan while
Mahayana around Bamiyan and north.

IndoScythian Kingdom probably patronized Dharmaguptakan school, which was replaced after the Kushan Empire established
itself and patronized Sarvastivada instead. So Dharmaguptaka in d_sakastan and south while Mahayana in the North.

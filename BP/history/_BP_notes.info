Move Bodh Gaya holy site to Bodh Gaya proper and move Mahabodhi Temple to it as well.
Fix Ellora Caves location (if not already done in Dharmachakra)

Fix Khitan Tuyuhun chars

Turkic/Arab succession laws needed for arab titles

======================================
Additional Map/Culture patches
--------------------------------------
* Fix overly large titles in Scandinavia
* Replace easternmost Ostyak culture with WtWSMS Yenisei culture (Siberian group)
* Dakshina Kosala ("Southern Kosala") should include Bhadravati, Sirpur, Tummana, and Ratanpur as historical cities
	in the region
* Review Irish/Scottish holdings; too many temples exist
* Make Egyptian/Near East Miaphysite provinces Nicene before Chalcedon
* Make Afar Provinces Somali so that Afar branches off from Somali (probably branched out circa CK3 timeline)

Check on Zenon's dynasty/house

Fix death_murder_known localization

Fix k_northumbria, k_lombardia not have COAs

======================================
History notes:
--------------------------------------
* 497/499 - Synod occurs abolishing celebacy for Nestorian clerics
* Vajrayana didn't seem to spread outside fo India until 716 when the Zhenyan tradition was established in China
* More details for the maternal/paternal history of the early Catholicos of Armenia

======================================

	South Slavic
		vlach

	Iberian
		All of it especially vis-a-vis CK3 1.5 culture mechanics
	South Slavic
		arberian
	Turkic

======================================
Possiblities:
--------------------------------------
* Separate Caucasian Albanian faith that can ping-pong between communion with georgian_orthodox and armenian_apostolic?
Or events that make ping-ponging between those churches possible?
* Potential hybrid (post-Royal Court DLC): Kashmiri-Zhangzhung hybrid in the Baltiyul region?

======================================
CHARACTER NOTES:
--------------------------------------
* Persio/Georgian culture for Georgian Arsacids (Post-1.5 Patch)?
* In particular, revisit culture/religion assumptions for the various rulers of the Georgian principalities
* Add spouse for Rev II of Iberia (char #202) for Salome of Tiridates III

======================================
ETHOGENSIS ASSUMPTIONS:
--------------------------------------
Presumed origins of the Kurds are the various tribes around Mount Zagros

======================================
EVEN MORE BUDDHISM NOTES:
--------------------------------------
Notes: Faxian's route through north afghanistan seems to indicate a mix of Dharmaguptaka,
Mahayana, and Sarvastivada schools in Tarim region.

Mahayana seemed to explode in the 4th and 5th centuries, with only a few centers like c_mathura (in k_delhi) and
and Bamiyan (in k_bactria) before the 4th century. Ganhdara and Southern regions therefore should be Dharmaguptakan while
Mahayana around Bamiyan and north.

IndoScythian Kingdom probably patronized Dharmaguptakan school, which was replaced after the Kushan Empire established
itself and patronized Sarvastivada instead. So Dharmaguptaka in d_sakastan and south while Mahayana in the North.

Give Nangchos the option of embracing one of the four Buddhist Schools of Lamaism

======================================
REQUIRES LANDED TITLES TO DETERMINE:
--------------------------------------
Determine how Bavari are to arise:
	Admixture of Romano-Noric with Rugii settlers?
Determine how Roman splits into Italian and Cisalpine (aka Lombardic culture)

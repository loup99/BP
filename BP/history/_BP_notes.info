History notes:
--------------------------------------
* 497/499 - Synod occurs abolishing celebacy for Nestorian clerics
* Vajrayana didn't seem to spread outside fo India until 716 when the Zhenyan tradition was established in China
* More details for the maternal/paternal history of the early Catholicos of Armenia

======================================
Possiblities:
--------------------------------------
* Separate Caucasian Albanian faith that can ping-pong between communion with georgian_orthodox and armenian_apostolic?
Or events that make ping-ponging between those churches possible?
* Potential hybrid (post-Royal Court DLC): Kashmiri-Zhangzhung hybrid in the Baltiyul region?

======================================
CHARACTER NOTES:
--------------------------------------
* Persio/Georgian culture for Georgian Arsacids?
* In particular, revisit culture/religion assumptions for the various rulers of the Georgian principalities
* Add spouse for Rev II of Iberia (char #202) for Salome of Tiridates III

ETHOGENSIS ASSUMPTIONS:
--------------------------------------
Presumed origins of the Kurds are the various tribes around Mount Zagros

======================================
EVEN MORE BUDDHISM NOTES:
--------------------------------------
Notes: Faxian's route through north afghanistan seems to indicate a mix of Dharmaguptaka,
Mahayana, and Sarvastivada schools in Tarim region.

Mahayana seemed to explode in the 4th and 5th centuries, with only a few centers like c_mathura (in k_delhi) and
and Bamiyan (in k_bactria) before the 4th century. Ganhdara and Southern regions therefore should be Dharmaguptakan while
Mahayana around Bamiyan and north.

IndoScythian Kingdom probably patronized Dharmaguptakan school, which was replaced after the Kushan Empire established
itself and patronized Sarvastivada instead. So Dharmaguptaka in d_sakastan and south while Mahayana in the North.

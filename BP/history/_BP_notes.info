Barony Terrain changes:
--------------------------------------
Oasis: 4555, 6106,6207,5987,6154,6176,6192
Milder Climates: 4558, 4555, 4556

======================================
Possiblities:
--------------------------------------
* Greco-Afghan culture hybrid in Kandhar (c_rukhaj). Was attested to as late as 100 AD by Isadore of Charax
* Separate Caucasian Albanian faith that can ping-pong between communion with georgian_orthodox and armenian_apostolic?
Or events that make ping-ponging between those churches possible?
* Potential hybrid (post-Royal Court DLC): Kashmiri-Zhangzhung hybrid in the Baltiyul region?

======================================
CHARACTER NOTES:
--------------------------------------
* Georgian/Armenian Arascids etc. need to be reworked into the new dynasty/house format
* Persio/Georgian culture for Georgian Arsacids?
* In particular, revisit culture/religion assumptions for the various rulers of the Georgian principalities
* Add spouse for Rev II of Iberia (char #202) for Salome of Tiridates III

======================================
ETHOGENSIS ASSUMPTIONS:
--------------------------------------
Presumed origins of the Kurds are the various tribes around Mount Zagros

======================================
EVEN MORE BUDDHISM NOTES:
--------------------------------------
Notes: Faxian's route through north afghanistan seems to indicate a mix of Dharmaguptaka,
Mahayana, and Sarvastivada schools in Tarim region.

Mahayana seemed to explode in the 4th and 5th centuries, with only a few centers like c_mathura (in k_delhi) and
and Bamiyan (in k_bactria) before the 4th century. Ganhdara and Southern regions therefore should be Dharmaguptakan while
Mahayana around Bamiyan and north.

IndoScythian Kingdom probably patronized Dharmaguptakan school, which was replaced after the Kushan Empire established
itself and patronized Sarvastivada instead. So Dharmaguptaka in d_sakastan and south while Mahayana in the North.

Give Nangchos the option of embracing one of the four Buddhist Schools of Lamaism

	Admixture of Romano-Noric with Rugii settlers?
Determine how Roman splits into Italian and Cisalpine (aka Lombardic culture)

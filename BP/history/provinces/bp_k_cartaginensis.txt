# Notes:
# Toledo was the center of a large number of synods, especially against priscillianism in the Vth and VIth century.
# Changing d_citerior and d_toletum t be nicene instead of priscillianism
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councils_of_Toledo
#
# This brings the distribution of priscillianism more in line with being in north and western portions of Hispaniae

# Barbarian Settlement
#	* Visigothic settlement regions in Hispania [1]:
#		Mérida, Barcelona, Hispalis, Toledo, Rioja
#		Upper reaches of the Douro, Ebro, Tagus river basin and Tierra de Campos
#
# So as Visigothic numbers were limited vis-a-vis the Romano-Hispanics, probably should be in the more underedveloped
# regions of Spain. Based on this, I'd say:
#	c_madrid, c_cuenca (Tagus River basin/Toledo); 
#	c_burgos, c_valladolid (Douro River basin/Tierra de Campos [2])
#	c_lleida (Barcelona/Ebro)
#	c_alarcon (Barcelona/Ebro)
#	c_olemdo, c_segovia, c_avila (Center of Gothic settlement in [3])

# Vandal presensce also appeared to be less than a decade, too short to settle in the heavily populated south.

# Lusitanian dies out with progression of Nicene, as does Andorran basque

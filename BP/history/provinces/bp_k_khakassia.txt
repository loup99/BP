# Most of the Xianbei, by this time, would have been moved to the Ordos Valley/East of Baikal/Selenga river
# [1] is the case of the Xianbei State (147-234) while [2] covers the Ninrun Khagante (330-555), which is of
# far greater interest to 476.

# Kyrgyz were more centered on the Yenisei/Tuva region, and were probably not as far south as Mongolia [3]. I think
# they fill in the Qushe/Kipchak?, especially as the earliest attestations for Kipchaks are the Middle Ages.

# NB: the Munusinsk Depression/Minusinsk Basin/Ninuinsk hollow corresponds to Abkhan/Khaskass Hollow region.
#
# Given the Yenisei curves East shortly after Abakan [4], the mountains called "ALTAISHAN" should probably be the 
# Kirghiz/Ostyak cultural border.

# Paradox Notes:
# Many of the duchies, counties & baronies are named after geographical features and overall regions
# The vast majority of cities are fairly modern, at the very least from Renaissance era

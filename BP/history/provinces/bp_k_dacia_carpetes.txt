# Notes:
# ============
# Iazyges
# Iazyges became increasingly diffuse by the IVth century and were settled in and around the Tisza/Tisa river,
# their tradicinal location [1,2,3]. Listed under [4] are later princes which might be accurate but I can't access
# the text unfortunately. Also note that the Gepids are listed as only occupying the eastern bank of the Tisza river
# in this map [5]; I suspect the "Huns" lists under Gepid control were actually Iazyges/Roxolani/Sarmatians.
#
# My general impression is that the Iazyges were probably absorbed into the Huns and the 
# Amospados in WtWSMS represents the Iazyges/Roxolani/Sarmatian groups that survived the Hunnic conquests.

# ============
# Heruli
# Probably Quadi/Suebi/Sciri; definitely East German/Alan/Sarmatian mix by 476 [1].
# Heruli probably didn't extend nearly as far as WtWSMS. [2-4] seems to more accurately represent the Heruls being bound
# by the Carpathians; given the extent of the Przeworsk-Zarubintsy culture and assuming those were Proto-Slavs, reducing
# the bounds of the Heruls seems justified. So the Heruls are relative newcomers, ruling over an admixture of people in 
# the Danube basin while having a Herul stronghold in the mountains

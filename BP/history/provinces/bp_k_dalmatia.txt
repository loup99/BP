#Notes:
# Latest possible attestation of Illyrian is the 6th century, more definitely 4th-5th Century (St. Jerome)
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_language#Era
#
# So parts of Illyria, especially the mountains, were still likely tribal and pagan until the 6th century
# when the Slavs invaded. Probably played a role in the evolution of the Bosnian Church
#
# There was a mithraic_pagan temple in Jajce, so having a Mithra county that quickly sucumbs to Nicene

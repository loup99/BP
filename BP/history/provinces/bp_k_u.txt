# Notes:

#Removed non-tribal holdings in Sumpa land as they were tribals (according to Khotan sources)

# "The Sumpa/Supi are associated with the Supiya of Kharosthi documents of about 300 CE from the Tarim Basin.
# They are described as being among the invaders of the Kingdom of Khotan ('the red-faced (Tibetans), Huns, Chinese, 
# Supiya'). To the Khotanese, who had been a settled people for about a thousand years, they appeared as savage 
# and uncouth. They are also mentioned as having been in Niya and Cherchen.[10][11][12]"
#
#The Supi have also been closely associated with mysterious "Kingdoms of Women" during 
# the Sui dynasty (581-617 CE).[13][14] "A queen of the Suvarnagotra in the western ?? Niu-kuo [Pinyin: Nüguo] of women was called in Chinese Su-p'i, which may indicate a woman of the Supiya."[15] "

# Most of the Xianbei, by this time, would have been moved to the Ordos Valley/East of Baikal/Selenga river
# [1] is the case of the Xianbei State (147-234) while [2] covers the Ninrun Khagante (330-555), which is of

# Kyrgyz were more centered on the Yenisei/Tuva region, and were probably not as far south as Mongolia [3]. I think
# they fill in the Qushe/Kipchak?, especially as the earliest attestations for Kipchaks are the Middle Ages.

# Given the Yenisei curves East shortly after Abakan [4], the mountains called "ALTAISHAN" should probably be the 
# Kirghiz/Ostyak cultural border.

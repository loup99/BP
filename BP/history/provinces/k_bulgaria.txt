#k_bulgaria

##Religious note
#Khan Boris I sought conversion to monotheism in 863, finally converting to Orthodoxy in 864 (BYZ pressure)
#Before that, his land was still pagan, but some of his people had already converted
#So, we set as orthodox from the get go the southern parts of k_bulgaria (Bulgaria & Philippopolis) due to their closeness to BYZ
#Additionnally, Moesia will also start as orthodox, as it's the ruler's "capital territory"
#Dobrudja & Vidin will stay as slavic_pagan from start, and convert in 893 (after Boris' son, Vladimir,'s defeat when he tried a pagan uprising)
#Then, in the 1st half of the Xth century, Bogomilism appeared in south-western Bulgaria, until the end of the 2nd Bulgarian Empire

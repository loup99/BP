# Many of the duchies, counties & baronies are named after geographical features and overall regions
# The vast majority of cities are fairly modern, at the very least from Renaissance era

# Most of the kingdom is set as shamanic instead of tengri
# In reality, it's difficult to say because of the lack of records, and because there very likely was a lot of shamano-tengric syncretism

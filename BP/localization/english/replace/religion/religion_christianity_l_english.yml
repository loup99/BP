While these rites were in doctrinal agreement with one another, it led to some noticable behavioral and structural differences between the many rites in the East and West.\n\nIn Spain, the Hispanic Rite (or Mozarbic Rite, as it would later be called) was one such rite. Because of the relative tolerance of the Visigoths, this rite developed in communion with Rome to the present day."

 nestorian: "East Syriac Church"
 nestorian_adj: "Eastern Syriac"
 nestorian_adherent: "Eastern Syriac"
 nestorian_adherent_plural: "Eastern Syriacs"
 nestorian_desc: "One of the most divisive issues of the Early Christian Church centered on the nature of Christ and his relation to the Father. In Persia and Mesopotamia, the Syriac-speaking church utilized the dyophysite formulation that #EMP the human and divine #italic qnome#! of Christ are unmixed but eternally united in his #italic parsopa#!#!. The use of these Syriac terms, which did not map precisely to the Greek #italic physis#! (nature) and #italic hypostasis#! (person), along with the growing political divide between Christians in Persia and Rome, led to the schism between the East Syriac Church from the Roman Church in AD 431. It eventually garnered followers as far east as China, India, and even Mongolia."

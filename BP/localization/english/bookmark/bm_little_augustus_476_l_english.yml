Following a period of rebellion and usurpation, Odoacer led the Germanic foederati stationed in Italy against Romulus Augustus, displacing the boy emperor and founding the Kingdom of Italy. Thoroughly an integrated Roman citizen, his efforts were met with praise and reward from Zeno, the Emperor-in-the-East, as he was allowed to govern Italy as an independent Roman province. However, left without the support of the Eastern Roman Empire, Odoacer must meet the threats that for so long had destabilized the Western Roman Empire."

However, his greatest achievement would be to overthrow Odoacer and establish an Ostrogothic Kingdom across the entire Italian Peninsula.

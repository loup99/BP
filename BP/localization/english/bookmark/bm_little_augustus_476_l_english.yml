Meanwhile, Theodoric of the Ostrogoths looks at the peninsula, weighing his options. Will Rome fall to Odoacer? To Theodoric? Will the young Romulus Augustulus maintain his power against all odds, in the twilight of the Empire? Or will Julius Nepos, a shadow of his former self, rise once more to be hailed as Augustus?"

In 473, he would become the leader of the Ostrogoths of Pannonia, and less than ten years later, unite the Ostrogoths under his rule. However, his greatest achievement would be to overthrow Odoacer and establish an Ostrogothic Kingdom across the entire Italian Peninsula. Vying for a return to greatness, like that under the ancient Roman Empire, will his dreams come to fruition?"

 bookmark_476_odoacer_desc:0 "The mighty Odoacer was a citizen and general of Rome, and member of a Germanic foederati. Following a period of rebellion and usurpation, Odoacer led the Germanic foederati stationed in Italy against Romulus Augustus, displacing the boy emperor and founding the Kingdom of Italy. Thoroughly an integrated Roman citizen, his efforts were met with praise and reward from Zeno, the Emperor-in-the-East, as he was allowed to govern Italy as an independent Roman province. However, left without the support of the Eastern Roman Empire, Odoacer must meet the threats that for so long had destabilized the Western Roman Empire."

Arius, a third-century Christian priest in Alexandria, is considered to be the main theologian behind Arian teachings. The agitation Arianism caused amongst Early Christianity led to the council of Nicea in 325 which defined the nature of the Father and Son and declared the doctrine to be heretical. Spread through missionaries to various Germanic peoples who reimported it across the West with their implementations, Arianism would remain a competing church against mainstream Christianity."

They regarded Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites. The Ebionites used only one of the Jewish Gospels, revered James the Just and rejected Paul of Tarsus as an apostate from the Law. Their name suggests that they placed a special value on voluntary poverty. They have been identified as the meek and the poor Jesus spoke of in the Beatitudes, and the Ebionim was one of the terms used by the sect that sought to separate themselves from the corruption of the Temple, at Qumran, whom many believe were the Essenes."

 marcionism_desc:0 "Marcionism was an Early Christian dualist belief system that originated in the teachings of Marcion of Sinope at Rome around the year 144 AD. Marcion believed Jesus Christ was the savior sent by God, and Paul of Tarsus was his chief apostle, but he rejected the Hebrew Bible and the God of Israel. Marcionists believed that the wrathful Hebrew God was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament. This belief was in some ways similar to Gnostic Christian theology. Notably, both are dualistic, that is, they posit opposing gods, forces, or principles; one higher, spiritual, and 'good', and the other lower, material, and 'evil' (compare Manichaeism), in contrast to the orthodox Christian view that 'evil' has no independent existence, but is a privation or lack of 'good', a view shared by the Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides."

This is still sometimes called Limited Depravity. Thus, in contrast to 1 Corinthians 15:19-22, Adam's sin was "to set a bad example" for his progeny, but his actions did not have the other consequences imputed to original sin. Pelagianism views the role of Jesus as "setting a good example" for the rest of humanity as well as providing an atonement for our sins. In short, humanity has full control, and thus full responsibility, for obeying the Gospel in addition to full responsibility for every sin. According to Pelagian doctrine, because humans are sinners by choice, they are therefore criminals who need the atonement of Jesus Christ. Sinners are not victims, they are criminals who need pardon."

Melchisedechians consider parts of Genesis to be "Logia Melchizedek", that is, Melchizedek's Sayings, and hold that Melchizedek established a parallel, spiritual priesthood that was truly formed by his later incarnation as Jesus, in His role as High Priest In the Order of Melchizedek. Most of what is known about the Melchisedechian sect is found in Gnostic books and documents and a Catholic rebuttal text called "Against the Melchisedekites". The Melchisedechian Eucharist uniquely featured both the presence of fans and of a central flame, where the holy bread was deposited at the end of the ritual."

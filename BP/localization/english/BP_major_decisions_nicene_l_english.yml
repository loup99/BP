 nicene_decision_events.0001.desc:0 "Attempting to settle the disputes between the dyophysites and miaphysites, I have issued the Henotikon; the document anathemaizes Nestorian and and Monophysite positions and supports Cyril's twelve anathemas, but takes no stance on Christ's nature.\n\n However, those bishops and rulers outside my realm object strongly to the unilateral way I have imposed this formulation on the Empire."
 nicene_decision_events.0001.a:0 "They will come, in time, to accept the document."

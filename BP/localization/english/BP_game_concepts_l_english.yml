 game_concept_high_tribal_centralization_desc:0 "$game_concept_high_tribal_centralization$ represents the degree of centralization of the liege over his [vassals|E] and the state, shifting away from old tribal traditions in favor of a more powerful state.\n\nWhile it has many of the same features as [tribes|E], the [development_growth|E] in [high_tribal|E] counties depends upon the [high_tribal_centralization|E]; at [high_tribal_centralization_0|E], there is a #N 40%#! [development_growth|E] malus, with the malus decreasing with increasing levels of centralization.\n\nThere are four levels of $game_concept_tribal_authority$: [disparate_tribes|E], [limited_tribal|E], [high_tribal|E], and [absolute_tribal|E]. Increasing $game_concept_tribal_authority$ costs an amount of [prestige|E] depending on the level and the ruler's [learning_skill|E].\n\n#weak Vassals dislike higher levels of $game_concept_high_tribal_centralization$, and lowering it is the primary goal of any [liberty_faction|E]."

 game_concept_migration:0 "Migrations"
 game_concept_migration_desc:0 "From AD 400 to AD 800, hundreds of thousands of disparate peoples migrated into what was once Roman lands, reshaping the culture and religion of the regions they occupied. The Migration [casus_belli|E] are available to Pagans of the Germanic, Tengrist, or Slavic religion, as well as the Alans before AD 800.\n\nMigrations come in two flavors:  Minor, modeling a transfer of elites, and Major, modeling the more large-scale migrations depicted in popular culture."

 game_concept_christian_creeds:0 "Creeds"
 game_concept_christian_creeds_desc:0 "To model the doctrinal differences that were key points of the period following the fall of Rome, the Ecumenism doctrine has been removed and split into a Chalcedeon and Miaphysite creed. Faiths with Chalcedon consider each other righteous and Miaphysites astray, and the opposite is true for Miaphysites. This allows for greater gradiation in terms of how Christian faiths considered each other during the period."

 game_concept_migration:0 "Migrations"
 game_concept_migration_desc:0 "From AD 400 to AD 800, hundreds of thousands of disparate peoples migrated into what was once Roman lands, reshaping the culture and religion of the regions they occupied. The Migration [casus_belli|E] are available to Pagans of the Germanic, Tengrist, or Slavic religion, as well as the Alans before AD 800.\n\nMigrations come in two flavors:  Minor, modeling a transfer of elites, and Major, modeling the more large-scale migrations depicted in popular culture."
 #All about religions
 game_concept_christian_creeds:0 "Creeds"
 game_concept_christian_creeds_desc:0 "To model the doctrinal differences that were key points of the period following the fall of Rome, the Ecumenism doctrine has been removed and split into a Chalcedeon and Miaphysite creed. Faiths with Chalcedon consider each other righteous and Miaphysites astray, and the opposite is true for Miaphysites. This allows for greater gradiation in terms of how Christian faiths considered each other during the period."

Coding Philosophy Notes:

0). Above all else, code that works is better than code that doesn't or code that's pretty!

1). Whenever possible, write code to a separate file instead of overwriting Vanilla

    Reason: Keeps code base fairly harmonized whenever vanilla updates

2). Make Vanilla overwrites sparse
    a). If needing to only overwrite some components, create a new file <fname>_BP_overwrite.txt
        i). Avoids needless Vanilla inclusion and makes maintenance easier
    b). If Vanilla files must be overwritten (e.g., removal), try to keep meticulous records of what was changed
        i). Makes maintenance easier if we have explanations as to why changes were need
    c). Whenever overriding Vanilla keys/files use the following indicators
        i). When changing one line, or removing a code block, note with "##### Changed from Vanilla: "
        ii). When changing a block of lines, start with "##### Changed from Vanilla vvvvv" and end with "##### Changed from Vanilla ^^^^^"
            Reason: Keeps things easily regex searchable

3). When importing a vanilla file into BP for overwriting on a PR, try to have one commit for importing the file and a second commit for doing the changes

    Reason: It will make reviewing your PR easier for the reviewer, since they'll be able to see the exact lines changed by comparing from import commit to the HEAD commit

4). CK3 scripting supports quasi-templating like code via $NAME$ semantics, where $NAME$ is replaced inline [1]. Use that to reduce code duplication.

    Reason: Code duplication leads to the risk of some blocks of code being missed and makes maintenance harder

5). Place as many references as possible in common/scripted_effects/ and common/scripted_triggers/ instead of in actionable folders like common/decisions/ or common/laws/

    Reason: Prevents having code spread out across files for ease of maintenance

6). One line are preferred whenever possible [2]

    Reason: Prevents extraneous folding in Notepad++/Visual Studio and improves code clarity

7). The more complicated the code, the more comments are needed to explain what you're trying to do

    Reason: Code does exactly what you tell it to do. Best also explain what you want it to do as well

Examples

[1] Pseudo-code example make_feudal.txt:

if = {
	limit = { this.tier >= tier_barony }
	do_thing = { NAME = this }
}

common/scripted_effects/effects.txt:
	do_thing = {
		$NAME$.holder = { change_government = feudal_government }
	}

[2] Do this: this.faith = { has_doctrine = core_tenet_blah } Not this:

this.faith = {
	has_doctrine = core_tenet_blah
}

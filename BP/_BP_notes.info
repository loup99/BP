TODOs:
	Flags needed for culture/religion template spawning (as in: You can _now_ spawn since the precusor events are done)
		[00_pool_repopulation_character_template.txt:pool_repopulate_local_flavor]
		cultures: ashkenazi, sephardi, hindustani, burmese, cuman
		religions: iconoclast, paulician, ibadi, sufri, yazidi, ashari, kabarism
	Fix Mazban contract issues
	Move Bodh Gaya holy site to Bodh Gaya proper and move Mahabodhi Temple to it as well.
	Fix Ellora Caves location (if not already done in Dharmachakra)

======================================
Additional Map/Culture patches
--------------------------------------
* Fix overly large titles in Scandinavia
* Dakshina Kosala ("Southern Kosala") should include Bhadravati, Sirpur, Tummana, and Ratanpur as historical cities
	in the region
* Make Egyptian/Near East Miaphysite provinces Nicene before Chalcedon

======================================
Additional Culture/Hybrid Notes
--------------------------------------
* Replace easternmost Ostyak culture with WtWSMS Yenisei culture (Siberian group)
* Determine how Bavari are to arise:
	Admixture of Romano-Noric with Rugii settlers?
* Determine how Roman splits into Italian and Cisalpine (aka Lombardic culture)

======================================
Extraneous Cultures
--------------------------------------
Unless otherwise specified, file location is WtSWMS location
--------------------------------------
* To Remove (Duplicates):
	Caucasian
		Aghbanian (duplicate)
* To Review:
	Iberian
		All of it especially vis-a-vis CK3 1.5 culture mechanics
	South Slavic
		arberian
	Turkic
		All of them (so many subdivisions)
	Frankish
		All of them; frankish is now a latin group, but the remainder should be handled
* No WTWSMS References in Events/Decisions:
	Byzantine
		spartan
	East Semitic
		eblaite
	Proto-Carpathian
		veneti
	South Slavic
		sklav, antae, tracki, alzzecio
	West Slavic
		geruly, tyuringii, nordvind, czech, polabian, slovien
* Ancient cultures without references:
	East Semitic
		akkadian, aramaic (is referenced in events/WTWSMS_zoroastrian_sects.txt)
	Northwest Semitic
		samosatan

======================================
Possiblities:
--------------------------------------
* Separate Caucasian Albanian faith that can ping-pong between communion with georgian_orthodox and armenian_apostolic?
Or events that make ping-ponging between those churches possible?
* Potential hybrid (post-Royal Court DLC): Kashmiri-Zhangzhung hybrid in the Baltiyul region?

======================================
ETHOGENSIS ASSUMPTIONS:
--------------------------------------
Presumed origins of the Kurds are the various tribes around Mount Zagros

======================================
EVEN MORE BUDDHISM NOTES:
--------------------------------------
Notes: Faxian's route through north afghanistan seems to indicate a mix of Dharmaguptaka,
Mahayana, and Sarvastivada schools in Tarim region.

Mahayana seemed to explode in the 4th and 5th centuries, with only a few centers like c_mathura (in k_delhi) and
and Bamiyan (in k_bactria) before the 4th century. Ganhdara and Southern regions therefore should be Dharmaguptakan while
Mahayana around Bamiyan and north.

IndoScythian Kingdom probably patronized Dharmaguptakan school, which was replaced after the Kushan Empire established
itself and patronized Sarvastivada instead. So Dharmaguptaka in d_sakastan and south while Mahayana in the North.

Give Nangchos the option of embracing one of the four Buddhist Schools of Lamaism

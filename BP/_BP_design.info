Alpha Notes:
=================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Contentious Alpha Features (Will need Loup's review):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Culture:
	* Hepthalite, Xionite culture merged into Huna for improved cultural accuracy
	* Writing now only spreads to adjacent cultures via can_progress trigger
	* Reduced number of heritages so that culture and heritage aren't as synonymous as before (476 cultures listed only):
		* Created Levantine heritage, merging Northwest and East Semitic:
			* Assyrian, Punic, Aramean
		* Replaced Central Semitic with Arabic and merged with South Semitic:
			* Adnantie, Nabatean, Yathribi, Himyarite, Sabaean, Minaean, Hadhramaut, Tribal Arab, Khalan
		* Created Coptic Heritage, related to Arabic and Levantine
			* Coptic
Religion:
	* Tengrism and Magyar Paganism are faiths of the same steppe religion
Governments:
	* Bureaucratic governments have non-capital containing titles revert to lieges on death (ala CK2 viceroys)
	* Gubernatorial governments don't have independence factions
	* Eranshar governments don't have independence factions if under e_persia
	* Liberty faction only applies to certian governments (those with player-modifiable laws)
Gameplay:
	* Added titular drift mechanic so titular titles can establish themselves
	* Prevent the creation of de jure kingdoms and empires without certain innovations (custom decisions are still fine)
	* Added Tribal Kingdom/Empire shatter mechanic to model stateless societies (i.e., without social stratification innovation); enabled via rule
	* Certain titles (like cultural tribes) shouldn't be revokable

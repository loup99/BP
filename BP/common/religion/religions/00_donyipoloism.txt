#LT-Rascek: Taken from herkles "Dharmachakra"
#and modified; moved bathouism and sanamahism 
#into this family as well; they are all
#Tibeto-Burman faiths
#
#Usage Note:
#Latest Version: 1.2.0 "Saraswati" (Released 26/12/2020)
#
#Dharmachakra is a flavor mod for CK3 focused on the Indian Subcontient and the neighboring regions of Burma and Tibet, as well as the Dharmic Religions of Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism and religions influenced by them.
#
#Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

To Do Tasks:
Fix Dhamchakra error list
	dharma_special_buildings, dharma_onactions
Revisit Dhamchakra's special tribal/cultural religion notes

Revamp Bon to use patron gods instead of ritual celebrations

Impelement Hindu subsects as decision

Impelement celibacy tweaks to hellenism (invalid for some Greco-Roman, but valid for Pythagoreanism and should be for Cybelianism)

Revisit Christian doctrine and tenet interactions
	Communion Tenet vs. Eucharistic Theology
	Make Demiurge consider Jews evil even with Christian syncretism
	Trinitarian valid for Gnostic iff it includes melchisidekianism

==================
Strech Goals:
------------------
See if new category besides "shunned" is possible for antinomians (shunned effects w/o hooks or devotion loss, just opinion loss)
	Yes, but touches quite a bit of code for a more precise flavorization and opinion modeling...
Add more gameplay interaction between tenets and Christian doctrines

==================
Eventual work:
------------------
Replace peregrinition_decision select_and_move_to_pool_effect with new effect that makes pagan locales more popular
Add baldness/tonsure to peregrinition tenet for monks
Make it so other pagans can adopt sacred eunuchs

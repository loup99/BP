To Do Tasks:
Fix Dhamchakra error list
Revamp Bon to use patron gods instead of ritual celebrations
Revisit Dhamchakra's special tribal/cultural religion notes
Impelement Hindu subsects as decision
Impelement celibacy tweaks to hellenism (invalid for some Greco-Roman, but valid for Pythagoreanism and should be for Cybelianism)

Strech Goals:
See if new category besides "shunned" is possible for antinomians (shunned effects w/o hooks or devotion loss, just opinion loss)
	Yes, but touches quite a bit of code for a more precise flavorization and opinion modeling...

Eventual work:
Replace peregrinition_decision select_and_move_to_pool_effect with new effect that makes pagan locales more popular
Add baldness/tonsure to peregrinition tenet for monks
Make it so other pagans can adopt sacred eunuchs

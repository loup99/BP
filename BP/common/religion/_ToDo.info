Big Tasks

* Revisit Christian doctrine and tenet interactions
	Demigurge: Negate Opinion Bump for Jews with Christian Syncretism (will require more work on understanding how to do triggered opinion mechanics)
* See if new category besides "shunned" is possible for antinomians (shunned effects w/o hooks or devotion loss, just opinion loss)
	Yes, but touches quite a bit of code for a more precise flavorization and opinion modeling...
* More interaction between Heterodox Hindu Philosophies and options:
	E.g., no determining a Bhakti or founding holy orders or pilgrimages
	Figure out how to dynamically remove opinion penalties for criminal/shunned activites

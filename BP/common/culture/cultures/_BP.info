Other name issues:
	00_latin.txt:
		Many names have equivalents and were ported directly from WtWSMS and did not take advantage of
		/common/culture/culture_names/ mapping. Those have been suppressed for now, but should be cleaned up.
		As LT-Rascek is not sure which to use for most of the cultures, he has left it for a more knowledgable
		individual to fix.

		Cultures with suppressed names:
		frankish, roman, gallo_romance, romano_gallic, romano_frank, romano_african, arreyanu, raetoroman,
		noricroman, romano_british, british_romance, romano_aramean, dalmatian, romano_vandalic, thraco_roman,
		illyro_roman, pannonian, pannonian_romance, romano_hispanic, romano_dacian, romano_gothic

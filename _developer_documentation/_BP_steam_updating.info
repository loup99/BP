How to update the Mod on Steam as a Collaborator
------------------------------
The below is a best recollection of how LT-Rascek did it.
It's Windows-focused as well.

1). Create a new folder for the mod, preferably on a new drive if you have one, one besides C: and the drive with Steam.
    This is probably _not_ an issue, but sidesteps any issues with using Windows-name-based folders.
    We'll call this Z:\WTWSMS for convenience.
2). Copy the mod information over to Z:\WTWSMS
3). Fixup the descriptor.mod.info in Z:\WTWSMS to be descriptor.mod
4). Change the path within the descriptor.mod file; that is, the one the descriptor actually is in, to point to Z:\WTWSMS
5). In the Crusader Kings 3 mod folder, create a new *.mod file that points to the mod in Z:\WTWSMS.
    Name it WtWSMS-Deploy.mod. It will be pretty much a carbon copy of the descriptor in Z:\WTWSMS.
6). Launch the game, goto "All Installed Mods" and select your WtWSMS copy for deployment via "Upload a Mod".
    It should populate everything automatically.
7). Goto Steam. If you see a banner talking about "automated content check system", you did it!

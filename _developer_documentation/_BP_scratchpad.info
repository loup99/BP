FUTURE IDEAS
======================
* Make Fall of Rome/Constantinople a unique memory
* RtP DLC Traditions:

* common/council_tasks/sea_minority_*

* "Challenge Character" Fix/Replace/Remove
* Review Peregrinition in light of vows of poverty et al having voluntary landlessness
* guis - see if tab addition code is usable by other GUI elements
* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt

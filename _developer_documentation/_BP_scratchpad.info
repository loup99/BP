RtP Stuff
======================

To-Fix Files:
----------------------

* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt
* common/culture/traditions/BP_*.txt - taking advantage of new DLC stuff

* common/scripted_triggers/00_scripted_rule_triggers_BP_overwrite.txt - Might have obviated `culture_can_raid_even_if_feudal` tradition parameter with `culture_can_raid_over_land_even_if_feudal_no_restrictions`, but might not have...
* common/scripted_triggers/BP_interaction_triggers.txt - Need to tie with new State Religion concept

* common/landed_titles/*.txt - fix some disjoint counties in Byzantium
	* Isauria, Kyzistra (might just be a map_data issue though)

* common/laws/BP_title_succession_laws.txt - see if we can cut the *_tmp off the database item

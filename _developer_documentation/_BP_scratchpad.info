Miscellany:
----------------------

* Tributary interaction logic is breaking demand tributary interactions in Vanilla.

0.1.7.2:
* Destroy Verinus house/dynasty banner (or gift to Verinus) after loosing the war?
* Extend "Pay Homage" interaction to WtWSMS permanent tributary types?

0.1.8: Matter of Britain:
* Readd Angaria, Albingia as Duchies in Saxony
Migration Wars:
	* Migration overhaul; should become easier, minor migrations should become more common
	* Letting migrants settle should block a realm from further minor migration for a while
* Further cleanup of tribal titles & conversion to confederations
	* Confederations for Alamannia, Thuringia (?!), Germanii, Lemovia, Vidvaria, and the various other small tribal polities
	* Confederation unification should be blocked without either Leges Barbarorum, Social Stratification, or Writing
* 2 more bookmarks: July 11, 472 (Gundobad refuses the crown?), December 9, 480 (Odoacer occupies Dalmatia)

Future:
* Odoacer as a notional tributary to Zeno?
* More conqueror spawning
	* Primarily driven by claimant wars (see conqueror.0001 in 00_war_effects.txt), so we need to expand this.
* Migratory Tribe landless government?
* Expand Steppes decision: re-enable
* Update relationship & history of Ostrogothic & Visigothic to match new migratory mechanics
* Found duchy decision for titular duchies/expand duchy decision/set de jure capital decision?
* Shunned Marriage doctrine (talk to RE team) for pre-celebacy faiths
* Update relationship & history of Ostrogothic & Thracian Gothic to match new migratory mechanics
* Become a "Legendary Leader" decision to get the trait, instead of just for history

Bugs????
---------
* Add an on-action to flip governments that can't hold cites & such to appropriate governments for feudals and clans and theocracies like

-----------------------------------------

Adventurer Overhaul:
* Adventurer landing should come with conversion & the trait should make changing cultures/learning the language easier
	* Strong hook should only apply for Evil Faiths, Weak hook for hostile faiths
	* Leader/follower traits should have easier time converting to dominant culture/faith if not having malleable invaders-type stuff
	* Player heirs should get leader trait instead of follower.
	* CCP3_special_buildings.txt

Code Cleanup:
	* Harmonize dynasty, character files
	* Consolidate:
		* Char history:
			* _BP_other_title_holders.txt, historical_characters_ck3.txt
			* Make illyro_roman.txt to romano_illyrian.txt
			* Finally: Consolidate all the "new character" history files into their respective *_ck3.txt bins
		* Consolidate localization/english/bookmark
	* Cleanup:
		* Remove: #Development by county
		\r\n\t#Development\r\n\t#Rulers - remove

FUTURE IDEAS
======================
* Make Fall of Rome/Constantinople a unique memory
* RtP DLC Traditions:
	* common/culture/cultures/* - New greek stuff (interfaces with admin governments, so needs to wait)
	* common/culture/traditions/BP_*.txt - taking advantage of new DLC stuff
* common/council_tasks/sea_minority_*
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt
* Remove minor migrations, should be a landless char thing instead.
* "Challenge Character" Fix/Replace/Remove
* Review Peregrinition in light of vows of poverty et al having voluntary landlessness
* guis - see if tab addition code is usable by other GUI elements
* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt
* East and West Slavic attire for when those heritages appear
* ccp3_special_buildings: This is really for when we hook in Rise of Islam at least and some overlap with Dharma buildings

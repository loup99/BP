In progress:
----------------------

* Francia should become part of Gaul Empire
* Aures should become part of North Africa Empire
* Latin heritage drift not blocked by polity control

With art:
* Make Kingdom formation events into splash events
* Kingdom Formation for Aures needs to become de jure part of North Africa
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt

More Consideration:
* Add Ritual Warfare Innovation to tribal, granting +1 MAA regiments??
    - All ranks should have -1 MAA regiments

==========================
0.1.8: Matter of Britain:

Migration Wars:
	* Migration overhaul; should become easier, minor migrations should become more common
	* Letting migrants settle should block a realm from further minor migration for a while
* Further cleanup of tribal titles & conversion to confederations
	* Confederations for Alamannia, Thuringia (?!), Germanii, Lemovia, Vidvaria, and the various other small tribal polities
* 2 more bookmarks: July 11, 472 (Gundobad refuses the crown?), December 9, 480 (Odoacer occupies Dalmatia)

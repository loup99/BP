Interim Notes (just in case computer gets bricked)

Senate:
Remaining Interaction Items:
	Events:
		* Letter event for granting Senator Status to a Senator
		* Letter event for consul nomination
		* Letter event for elevating dynasties to the Senate
	* Senate opinions from nominations need their own category (they overwrite) and probably needs clamping
	* Senate mechanics is_valids needs more text (missing perspectives)
	* Add ai_potential to senate interactions

Interactions:
	* Ability for individual Senators and families (if Dynast) to change Senates
	* AI senator chars more willing to come to your court if it puts them in the Senate
	* Senators demanding non-capital baronies for their families, proportional to their rank
		* Refusal annoys the whole Senate, approving it annoys the holder of the county up the vassal tree
	* Prisoners should _not_ be electable as consul, applied for the Senate, or count as in Rome.
Senatorial Vassal Stance:
	* Will apply to baronies as well...
	* Likes: Granting land to Senators, upgrading holdings, Triumphs, Chariot Races
	* Dislikes: Enobling commoners, marrying lowborns, nominating non-Senators, interfering with the Senate, revoking (non-capital) baronies
End of the Senate:
	* Have Senate collapse if/when there's no families or Senators in Rome/Constantinople anymore (like overrun by tribals taking everything that could land them)
	* Improve reasons for getting rid of the Senate as well, so players have a reason to destroy it
Traits:
	* Senator trait should have hostile scheme power bump plus stat bonuses
	* Stat bonuses should also be culturally dependent...
Other:
	* Have Senate collapse if/when there's no families or Senators in Rome anymore (like overrun by tribals taking everything)
	* AI Senators landed at game start aren't in their capitals.
	* Rename location triggers to be consistent with East/West (so we can generalize over a single adjective)
	* Review Consul/Approved-by-Senate modifier effects
	* Tie variables and lists to these titles instead.
	* Titles:
		* Remove Western Senate title as something held and block creation & remove unrevokable flag from database
		* Add similar title for Eastern Senate
			* Under Senate elections, reference this title for east/west senate elections in the toast message
		* Overhaul Events 0011-0050 and 1011-1050 in light of no d_senate holder
	* Trait Icons:
		* Separate ones for East and West Senators
		* Separate ones for East and West Former Consuls

RtP Stuff
======================
* Make a flag for Roman/Sub-Roman Governments to interfacw with Senate instead of checking governments individually (if that works...)

* Special Election Laws for Empires
* Fix-up/reimplement Roman and Iranian succession laws
* Review title & realm succession law unlocks again
* common/succession_elections/* - review and readd after governments

* Titular titles should be targetable for claims (???)

----------------------

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

To-Fix database items
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

New Government Handling needed:
* Replace as much as possible, has_government with government flag checking (do after decisions)
* Make non-Zoro Prefeudal Vassals of Eranian into Eranian with religion protection
	* And remove those vassal rights from game start

* Re-add administrative languages

====================================================================================

To-Fix Files:
----------------------
* common/council_tasks/sea_minority_*
* common/culture/cultures/*
* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt
* common/culture/traditions/BP_*.txt - taking advantage of new DLC stuff

* common/scripted_triggers/00_scripted_rule_triggers_BP_overwrite.txt - Might have obviated `culture_can_raid_even_if_feudal` tradition parameter with `culture_can_raid_over_land_even_if_feudal_no_restrictions`, but might not have...
* common/scripted_triggers/BP_interaction_triggers.txt - Need to tie with new State Religion concept

* common/landed_titles/*.txt - fix some disjoint counties in Byzantium
	* Isauria, Kyzistra (might just be a map_data issue though)

* common/laws/BP_title_succession_laws.txt - see if we can cut the *_tmp off the database item

* guis - see if tab addition code is usable by other GUI elements
* gui/frontend_main.gui

====================================================================================

Miscellany:
----------------------
Bugs:
* Fix everyone having 0 legitmacy at start

Maybe not bugs:

GFX Bugs:

* Fix the weirdness near Tarsus on the map

Typos:
* Rename flavor game concepts to history game concepts or something like that
* EFFECT_LIST_BULLET should have #indent_newline:3 #! attached to each line (*sigh*)

Other:
* Armenians should be title protected to prevent amalgamation into Eranshar titles
* Port in Marauders vassal_stance stuff

FUTURE IDEAS
======================
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt
* Remove minor migrations, should be a landless char thing instead.
* "Challenge Character" Fix/Replace/Remove

Miscellany:
----------------------
Maybe not bugs:
* Add an on-action to flip governments that can't hold cites & such to appropriate governments for feudals and clans and theocracies like

0.1.6:
* Tamp down migration rate and block it from converting your own provinces which are of your faith/religion
* Review tributary acceptance rates; might be too high.

0.1.7:
* Migration overhaul; should become easier, minor migrations should become more common
   * Letting migrants settle should block a realm from further minor migration for a while

FUTURE IDEAS
======================
* Make Fall of Rome/Constantinople a unique memory
* RtP DLC Traditions:
	* common/culture/cultures/* - New greek stuff (interfaces with admin governments, so needs to wait)
	* common/culture/traditions/BP_*.txt - taking advantage of new DLC stuff
* common/council_tasks/sea_minority_*
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt
* Remove minor migrations, should be a landless char thing instead.
* "Challenge Character" Fix/Replace/Remove
* Review Peregrinition in light of vows of poverty et al having voluntary landlessness
* guis - see if tab addition code is usable by other GUI elements
* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt

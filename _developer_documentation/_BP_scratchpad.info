RtP Stuff
======================
* Senate:
	* Make a flag for Roman/Sub-Roman Governments to interface with Senate instead of checking governments individually (if that works...)

====================================================================================

To-Fix Files:
----------------------
* common/council_tasks/sea_minority_*
* common/culture/cultures/* - New greek stuff
* common/culture/traditions/BP_*.txt - taking advantage of new DLC stuff

====================================================================================

Miscellany:
----------------------
Bugs:
* Remove inprocess errors and cleanup

Maybe not bugs:
* Add an on-action to flip governments that can't hold cites & such to appropriate governments for feudals and clans and theocracies like

GFX:
* Pull in new tradition gfx from branch
* Update faith icons from gfx branch

Typos:
* EFFECT_LIST_BULLET should have #indent_newline:3 #! attached to each line (*sigh*)

Other:
* Make Fall of Rome/Constantinople a unique memory
* Remove all "To Remove" errors in .known_errors and the error log clean up tool and fix those
* Touch up music file triggers
* Make Cataphracts not innovation locked anymore

FUTURE IDEAS
======================
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt
* Remove minor migrations, should be a landless char thing instead.
* "Challenge Character" Fix/Replace/Remove
* Review Peregrinition in light of vows of poverty et al having voluntary landlessness
* guis - see if tab addition code is usable by other GUI elements
* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt

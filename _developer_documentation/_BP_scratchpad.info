Miscellany:
----------------------
Maybe not bugs:

TODO:
* Senate approval should be revoked on rank down/not having the cities in your domain

Culture Fixes:
* Update all the culture histories accordingly

Culture mechanic fixes:

* Make Estonian &c. divergent/hybrid culture names

Map changes:
* Update the tribal histories in saamiland, especially in what was Finnish territory
* Review the split between Yenesian and Khanty; Khanty is definitely too far east
* Remove Kolochin, Dneiper Baltic Cultures
* lesser_poland duchy needs a new capital that's in it's territory
* Worms, Lugio should be the county capital of its county
* Napoca should include Napoca (c_torda); might need a new duchy or split current Napoca between Dacia and Dacia Carpentes
* Update minority game start stuff
* Hormdiak shouldn't be related to Attila

0.1.7:
* Remove CK3 CS color system as it is borked.
* Update bookmark structure
* Shunned Marriage doctrine (talk to RE team) for pre-celebacy faiths
* Migration overhaul; should become easier, minor migrations should become more common
   * Letting migrants settle should block a realm from further minor migration for a while

0.1.8 (Nomand DLC):
* Update relationship & history of Ostrogothic & Visigothic to match new migratory mechanics
* Found duchy decision for titular duchies/expand duchy decision/set de jure capital decision?
* found_empire_of_beth_nahrain_decision needs review, possible exclusion
* Remove Ostrogothic counties from the map

Code Cleanup:
	* Harmonize dynasty, character files
	* Consolidate:
		* Char history:
			* _BP_other_title_holders.txt, historical_characters_ck3.txt
			* Make illyro_roman.txt to romano_illyrian.txt
			* Finally: Consolidate all the "new character" history files into their respective *_ck3.txt bins
		* Consolidate localization/english/bookmark
	* Cleanup:
		* Remove: #Development by county
		\r\n\t#Development\r\n\t#Rulers - remove

Symmachus Branch for 0.1.7:
	* Landed title changes need a deep review and work.
	"- Replaced the default title localization for Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Oriens and parts of Balkans with the ancient names, as they are much more appropriate for almost every culture"
		* common/landed_titles
		* localization/english/replace/BP_titles_l_english.yml

FUTURE IDEAS
======================
* Make Fall of Rome/Constantinople a unique memory
* RtP DLC Traditions:
	* common/culture/cultures/* - New greek stuff (interfaces with admin governments, so needs to wait)
	* common/culture/traditions/BP_*.txt - taking advantage of new DLC stuff
* common/council_tasks/sea_minority_*
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt
* Remove minor migrations, should be a landless char thing instead.
* "Challenge Character" Fix/Replace/Remove
* Review Peregrinition in light of vows of poverty et al having voluntary landlessness
* guis - see if tab addition code is usable by other GUI elements
* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt
* East and West Slavic attire for when those heritages appear
* ccp3_special_buildings: This is really for when we hook in Rise of Islam at least and some overlap with Dharma buildings

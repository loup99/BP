Culture Fixes:
* Dialect Continua should have a choice factor
* Old Slavic should have history relating to Veneti et al.
* Carpodaci should have gothic heritage

Culture mechanic fixes:
* Migratory minorities should have a 1% chance per annum (about 50% chance in 70 years) of degrading
* Make Estonian &c. divergent/hybrid culture names
* Culture Blending should have a promote culture bonus for being applied to it

Map changes:
* At start, remove all of Romulus' MAA and give him only a few to make the war less favorable to him

Symmachus Branch for 0.1.7:
	* Landed title changes need a deep review and work.
	"- Replaced the default title localization for Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Oriens and parts of Balkans with the ancient names, as they are much more appropriate for almost every culture"
		* common/landed_titles
		* localization/english/replace/BP_titles_l_english.yml

FUTURE IDEAS
======================
* Make Fall of Rome/Constantinople a unique memory
* RtP DLC Traditions:
	* common/culture/cultures/* - New greek stuff (interfaces with admin governments, so needs to wait)
	* common/culture/traditions/BP_*.txt - taking advantage of new DLC stuff
* common/council_tasks/sea_minority_*
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt
* Remove minor migrations, should be a landless char thing instead.
* "Challenge Character" Fix/Replace/Remove
* Review Peregrinition in light of vows of poverty et al having voluntary landlessness
* guis - see if tab addition code is usable by other GUI elements
* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt
* East and West Slavic attire for when those heritages appear
* ccp3_special_buildings: This is really for when we hook in Rise of Islam at least and some overlap with Dharma buildings

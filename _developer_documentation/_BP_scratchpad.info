Interim Notes (just in case computer gets bricked)

Senate:

* Trait Icons:
	* Separate ones for East and West Senators
	* Separate ones for East and West Former Consuls
Other:
	* Revoking Senatorial holdings confers negative opinions of the Senate and may trigger rivalries if done without cause
	* Spent prestige groveling to the Senate should be distributed to the Senate and demanded prestige should come from the Senate
	* AI Senators landed at game start aren't in their capitals.
Cleanup:
	* Rename "roman_government_events" to "roman_senate_events" for additional clarity
Stretch Goals:
	* Ability for individual Senators and families (if Dynast) to change Senates
	* Tie into entrenched regencies, especially interactions
	* Senatorial Vassal Stance:
		* Will apply to baronies as well...
		* Likes: Granting land to Senators, upgrading holdings, Triumphs, Chariot Races
		* Dislikes: Enobling commoners, marrying lowborns, nominating non-Senators, interfering with the Senate, revoking (non-capital) baronies

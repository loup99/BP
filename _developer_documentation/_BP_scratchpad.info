* Minorities:
	* Review 00_pool_repopulation_character_templates.txt in light of minorities
	* Improve the minority information in the GUI
Culture/Religion:
	* Should Kushite be Coptic heritage instead?
	* Replace Afghan (incorrect, very modern) with Pactyan or Pakthas
	* Remove Indo-Parthian and replace with something more fitting (Gedrosian?)

Interim Notes (just in case computer gets bricked)

Senate:

Traits:
	* Senator trait should have hostile scheme power bump plus stat bonuses
	* Stat bonuses should also be culturally dependent...
	* Review Consul/Approved-by-Senate modifier effects

Senatorial Vassal Stance:
	* Will apply to baronies as well...
	* Likes: Granting land to Senators, upgrading holdings, Triumphs, Chariot Races
	* Dislikes: Enobling commoners, marrying lowborns, nominating non-Senators, interfering with the Senate, revoking (non-capital) baronies
End of the Senate:
	* Have Senate collapse if/when there's no families or Senators in Rome/Constantinople anymore (like overrun by tribals taking everything that could land them)
	* Improve reasons for getting rid of the Senate as well, so players have a reason to destroy it
Other:
	* Have Senate collapse if/when there's no families or Senators in Rome anymore (like overrun by tribals taking everything)
	* AI Senators landed at game start aren't in their capitals.
	* Tie variables and lists to these titles instead.
	* Modifiers
		* Review modifier bonuses/maluses
	* Titles:
		* Remove Western Senate title as something held and block creation & remove unrevokable flag from database
		* Add similar title for Eastern Senate
			* Under Senate elections, reference this title for east/west senate elections in the toast message
	* Trait Icons:
		* Separate ones for East and West Senators
		* Separate ones for East and West Former Consuls
Cleanup:
	* Rename "roman_government_events" to "roman_senate_events" for additional clarity
	* senator_in_rome_trigger/senator_in_constantinople_trigger should be East/West for consistent naming and templating
	* Split of senate_in_location trigger with can_be_in_senate trigger
		* Increases accuracy; someone _might_ be in the Senate, but is imprisoned or incapable and thus can't function
Stretch Goals:
	* Ability for individual Senators and families (if Dynast) to change Senates
	* Tie into entrenched regencies, especially interactions

=================================================================
Unfixable Errors; recheck every so often
=================================================================
* Building enable/disable states aren't checked at game start (so the Hellenic Parthenon is enabled for Christians in 476)
* Custom characters are feudal on day 1 (but flip on day 2); revist 0.1.7
* No mechanism to make HOF court chaplains in Vanilla (should revisit during 0.2.0 again)

* Inform PDX that Windows paths in *.mod files aren't read correctly
* Add an on-action to flip governments that can't hold cites & such to appropriate governments for feudals and clans and theocracies like

=================================================================
Long Term Design
=================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Roman Features
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Nika Riots:  Model as a special activity chain (not visible to the player, but functionally the same)
* Rework fall of rome event chain and the like; right now it yields destroyed/inherited history when it is better to be an inheritance
* Destroy Verinus house/dynasty banner (or gift to Verinus) after loosing the war?
* Non-Romans get reduced legitimacy in Sub-Roman government?
   * Roman cultures should get a legitimacy boost for inherit Roman-ness, at the cost of popular opinion
   * Sub-Roman government gets some sort of decision to boost legitimacy by supporting Roman traditions
* Provence should be part of Augustulus' Empire and transferred to the Visigoths as part of an alliance
* Review situation in Provence, including mechanics for handlings post-Odoacer victory return of Provence to Visigoths
* Culture:
	- Cultural "Romanization" trait tied to Romance cultures (maybe pop opinion boost or further reducing cultural acceptance issues)?
	- common/culture/cultures/* - New greek stuff (interfaces with admin governments, so needs to wait)
* Implement Legions
* Review the boundary between Greek and Illyrian cultures. Chimaira (part of Chaonia), Herakleia (part of Lynkestis) and Keletron (part of Orestis) should definitely be Greek.
* Extend "Pay Homage" interaction to WtWSMS permanent tributary types?
* Odoacer as a notional tributary to Zeno?
* Make Fall of Rome/Constantinople a unique memory
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Romanized Franks
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Overhaul confederate partition OR kingdom create_on_partition commands to prevent confederate partition weirdness
* Some decision for adopting sub-roman government based on a portion of the kingdom being sub-roman for Tribals/High Tribals (see Franks)
* common/council_tasks/sea_minority_*
* Merovingians should change COA to have bees instead of Quinotaur upon conversion to Christianity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Steppe
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* More Turco-Mongol work, especially on Culture
* Many namelists between cultures are identical; remove duplicates
* Tungusic name_list (instead of Jurchen)
* Yakut name_list for Kurykan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tribes and Migration
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Slavic rework
* Finnic/Sami Paganism separation?
* Chance of spawning Legendary Leader each time a char grows in prestige level or firstborn heir is born at a prestige level
	* Should be weighted by total of attribute values
* Migratory Tribe landless government?
* Port in old decisions for Heruls, Alamanni, &c. either as a religion feature or culture feature
* Tweak rise of minorities of the ruler culture/religion via on_action for pure tribals??
* Update relationship & history of Ostrogothic & Visigothic to match new migratory mechanics
* Update relationship & history of Ostrogothic & Thracian Gothic to match new migratory mechanics
* Found duchy decision for titular duchies/expand duchy decision/set de jure capital decision?
* Remove minor migrations, should be a landless char thing instead.
* New cultural emergence event for cultures that are blocked from vanilla cultural emergence
* East and West Slavic attire for when those heritages appear
* Adventurer Overhaul:
	* Adventurer landing should come with conversion & the trait should make changing cultures/learning the language easier
		* Strong hook should only apply for Evil Faiths, Weak hook for hostile faiths
		* Leader/follower traits should have easier time converting to dominant culture/faith if not having malleable invaders-type stuff
		* Player heirs should get leader trait instead of follower.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Christianity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Christian Doctrines:
	* Christologies influencing inter-faith views (hostile vs. evil)
	* Eucharistic Theology effects? Piety vs. Prestige vs. Same Faith Opinion
	* Remove Zealous/Cynical from Total Depravity; instead add `faith_modifiers` to them
	* Rites need to have some sort of effect
* Split Miaphysistism and Coptic Faith for Tenets? One covers the Egyptian practices, the other covers the Imperial practices (e.g., Anastasius I, Basilicus)
* Fixup conversion between rites of the Chalcedonian church
* Make the Gallican church have the same rite as the Hispanic Chuch
* Have Rites have an impact on conversion speed
* Review Peregrinition in light of vows of poverty et al having voluntary landlessness
* Make house_of_david the saviour variant for Jews
* Experiment with Pentarchs, possibly via some form of Situation
* Add Antinomian category (really just a clone of shunned) for antinomianism for the crime doctrines
* Extend GHW values in /common/script_values/02_religion_values.txt for preset holy site fallbacks and distance reductions
* Review handling of Rites vs Autocephaly in mokre detail
* Add cultural acceptance +5 for "righteous faiths sharing a HOF (e.g., Gallican,Celtic,Hispanic Rites)"
* Generalize control notions so that rites count for holy site control
* Shunned Marriage doctrine (talk to RE team) for pre-celebacy faiths
* Extend notion of creeds to encompass all possible (non-gnostic) Christian doctrine combinations
	* Add a decision to promulgate a new creed to tie in with this
* Buildings
	* Implement Church of the Holy Sepulchre
	* Implement Hagia Sophia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Persia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-Persian (Old Persian) Culture:
	* Implementation of Old Persian namelist if it isn't already used.
* Recreate An-Nahrawan from parts of b_an_nahrawan (current Ctesiphon) and b_baquba provinces
* Buildings
	* Implement Sarvestan Palace (or not?)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Islam
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Sabians, Mandeans, et al should have "People of the Book" modifiers
* ccp3_special_buildings: This is really for when we hook in Rise of Islam at least and some overlap with Dharma buildings
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Other
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Add Game Rule allowing creating more duchy-level tribals for players wanting more "traditional" wtwsms experience
* Rework Armorican namelist. The current Armorican namelist consists entirely of Breton and French names, while the Vasconic one have too many Visigothic names.
* Make cultures unavailable before their time, probably via on_action
* "Challenge Character" Fix/Replace/Remove
* Remove inapplicable rules, like mongol_invasion and hungarian_migration
* Implement more accurate succession law (sons of sisters inheriting) for Picts, Asturians
* Write localization checking code to double check everything being localized (non-trivial)
* Dynamically name creeds based on council locations
* Check name lists for accuracy with CK2 import
* Make Enarei use women's clothes
	* Quoting Celticus "men and womens clothing is fitted to bodies and has blend shapes, probably some of the most complicated ck3 modding and requires 3d modeling skills"
	* Quoting Celticus "For example 1 womens clothing is actually made of 10 models/variants"
* Code Cleanup:
	* Harmonize dynasty, character files
	* Consolidate:
		* Char history:
			* _BP_other_title_holders.txt, historical_characters_ck3.txt
			* Make illyro_roman.txt to romano_illyrian.txt
			* Finally: Consolidate all the "new character" history files into their respective *_ck3.txt bins
		* Consolidate localization/english/bookmark
	* Cleanup:
		* Remove: #Development by county
		\r\n\t#Development\r\n\t#Rulers - remove
-----------------------------------------------------------------
TODO, if PDX Fixes
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Mod the GUI to remove 0-piety sins/virtues?? Doesn't look like it is possible, or is at least horribly janked
* Swampland for Friisia, like the Arabia Felix modifier
* Tributary spam seems hopelessly borked
=================================================================
Very Short Term Plans
=================================================================
* More conqueror spawning
	* Primarily driven by claimant wars (see conqueror.0001 in 00_war_effects.txt), so we need to expand this.
* Cleanup character history files to be more organized again (i.e., breakup all the extra new character files into existing ones and resort files)
* Matter of Britain Situation
* Update pool_repopulation_character_templates for new cultures in game
* All events referencing tenet_aniconism should also reference tenet_iconoclasm
* common/name_equivalency/00_names.txt
All Under Heave:
	Add some clouds:

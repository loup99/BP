Big Notes
=================================================================
	* Long-Running feature branch:  move everything into their own files as much as possible to avoid constant collisions

=================================================================
Alpha Notes:
=================================================================
Unfixable Errors:
-----------------
* Building enable/disable states aren't checked at game start (so the Hellenic Parthenon is enabled for Christians in 476)
* Custom characters are feudal on day 1 (but flip on day 2); revist 0.1.7
* No mechanism to make HOF court chaplains in Vanilla (should revisit during 0.2.0 again)

Longer Term Plans:
-----------------
* Write localization checking code to double check everything being localized (non-trivial)
* Britannia:
	* Sub-Roman Britain Bookmark
	* Matter of Britain Struggle

-----------------------------------------------------------------
0.1.7 Plans
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup character history files to be more organized again (i.e., breakup all the extra new character files into existing ones and resort files)
* Inform PDX that Windows paths in *.mod files aren't read correctly
* Julius Nepos and disappearance of Rome events
* Review tributary acceptance rates; might be too high.
* Reorganize Bookmarks:
	* Split landless vs landed chars with DLC enabled flag
* Update dead dynasty prestiges (Ptolomids &c.)
* Rework Armorican and Vasconic namelists. The current Armorican namelist consists entirely of Breton and French names, while the Vasconic one have too many Visigothic names.
* Implementation of Noric culture for Romano-Noric History ; Namelists here: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/new-cultures.610605/
* Review the borders of e_dacia. It would be nice to be able to restore the borders of Roman Dacia, which is not possible with the vanilla setup. In addition, Dacia's de jure borders are probably wrong (for example, this empire includes the lands populated by Iazyges). The existing duchies and kingdoms also should be reworked (i.e d_napoca without Napoca and what even is Dacia Carpetes?).
* Odoacer's victory not displaying correctly in GUI

-----------------------------------------------------------------
0.1.8 Plans
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Provence should be part of Augustulus' Empire and transferred to the Visigoths as part of an alliance
* Review situation in Provence, including mechanics for handlings post-Odoacer victory return of Provence to Visigoths
* Remove inapplicable rules, like mongol_invasion and hungarian_migration
* Tribal Germanic Heritages:
	* 
	* Creation of Suebic heritage that'll evolve into Central Germanic
		* Either that or a loc change
	* Saxons should be West Germanic (more associated with Franks than Suebians)

Beta Notes:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Code Base:
	* Overhaul confederate partition OR kingdom create_on_partition commands to prevent confederate partition weirdness
* Government
	* Implement Legions
	* Implement more accurate succession law (sons of sisters inheriting) for Picts, Asturians
* Decisions
	* Some decision for adopting sub-roman government based on a portion of the kingdom being sub-roman for Tribals/High Tribals (see Franks)
	* Dynamically name creeds based on council locations
	* Merovingians should change COA to have bees instead of Quinotaur upon conversion to Christianity
	* Re-enable titular title creation for special titular titles (like BP_other_titles.txt)
* Culture
	* Remove inapplicable Vanilla cultures (will break a lot of things in the process) & rename culture files to vanilla pattern
	* Update pool_repopulation_character_templates for new cultures in game
	* Cultural "Romanization" trait tied to Romance cultures (maybe pop opinion boost or further reducing cultural acceptance issues)?
	* Ethno-Religious Work:
		* More Turco-Mongol work
	* Name Lists
		* Check name lists for accuracy with CK2 import
		* Many namelists between cultures are identical; remove duplicates
		* Tungusic name_list (instead of Jurchen)
		* Yakut name_list for Kurykan
		* Add tribal names as dynasties for some cultures where possible

* Features
	* Experiment with Pentarchs
	* Territorial transfer mechanic to model Odoacer giving Provence to the Visigoths and the Vandals giving most of Sicilia to Odoacer
	* Add missing localizations for Christian doctrine Trigger localizations (first, third, &c.)
* Map
	* Review Crimea and see how we want to break up the baronies
* Landed Titles
	* Recreate An-Nahrawan from parts of b_an_nahrawan (current Ctesiphon) and b_baquba provinces
	* Review Crimea and see how we want to break up the baronies. Tweak de jure borders of k_taurica to reflect historic extent of the Bosporan kingdom (for example, add Bata and Tanais).
	* Review the boundary between Greek and Illyrian cultures. Chimaira (part of Chaonia), Herakleia (part of Lynkestis) and Keletron (part of Orestis) should definitely be Greek.
* Religion
	* Add Antinomian category (really just a clone of shunned) for antinomianism for the crime doctrines
	* Extend GHW values in /common/script_values/02_religion_values.txt for preset holy site fallbacks and distance reductions
	* Extend notion of creeds to encompass all possible (non-gnostic) Christian doctrine combinations
		* Add a decision to promulgate a new creed to tie in with this
	* Add cultural acceptance +5 for "righteous faiths sharing a HOF (e.g., Gallican,Celtic,Hispanic Rites)"
	* Vegetarianism for Priscillianism, Miaphysitism (partial), some others
	* Generalize control notions so that rites count for holy site control
	* Sabians, Mandeans, et al should have "People of the Book" modifiers
* Buildings
	* Implement Church of the Holy Sepulchre
	* Implement Hagia Sophia
	* Implement Sarvestan Palace (or not?)
	* Implement silk weavers and silk capturing expeditions (for Romans and Greeks)
* Traits
	* Make house_of_david the saviour variant for Jews
* Events
	* New cultural emergence event for cultures that are blocked from vanilla cultural emergence
	* All events referencing tenet_aniconism should also reference tenet_iconoclasm
* 3D Modeling
	* Make Enarei use women's clothes
		* Quoting Celticus "men and womens clothing is fitted to bodies and has blend shapes, probably some of the most complicated ck3 modding and requires 3d modeling skills"
		* Quoting Celticus "For example 1 womens clothing is actually made of 10 models/variants"
* Other
	* Consider merging Vanilla imperial_reconquest_cb and the_roman_empires_imperial_reconquest_cb

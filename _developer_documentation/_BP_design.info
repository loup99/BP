=================================================================
Known Vanilla Bugs in Error Log (as of v. 1.6.1.2):
=================================================================
	* Issues with portrait_fp2_iberian_muslim_clothing_trigger and related vanilla clothing triggers
	* Odoacer's victory not displaying correctly in GUI

=================================================================
Alpha Notes:
=================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Contentious Alpha Features (Will need Loup's review):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Culture:
	* Greek and Roman are un-hybridizable via tradition choices
	* Romance, Greek, Kemetic, Armenian, and Levantine traditions block the vanilla culture_emergence_events
	* Hepthalite, Xionite culture merged into Hunas for improved cultural accuracy
	* Writing now only spreads to adjacent cultures via can_progress trigger
	* Reduced number of heritages so that culture and heritage aren't as synonymous as before (476 cultures listed only):
		* Created Levantine heritage, merging Northwest and East Semitic:
			* Assyrian, Punic, Aramean
		* Replaced Central Semitic with Arabic and merged with South Semitic:
			* Adnanite, Nabatean, Yathribi, Himyarite, Sabaean, Minaean, Hadhramaut, Tribal Arab, Khalan
		* Created Coptic Heritage, related to Arabic and Levantine
			* Coptic
Religion:
	* Tengrism and Magyar Paganism are faiths of the same steppe religion
Governments:
	* Bureaucratic governments have non-capital containing titles revert to lieges on death (ala CK2 viceroys)
	* Gubernatorial governments don't have independence factions
	* Eranshar governments don't have independence factions if under e_persia
	* Liberty faction only applies to certain governments (those with player-modifiable laws)
Gameplay:
	* Added titular drift mechanic so titular titles can establish themselves
	* Prevent the creation of de jure kingdoms and empires without certain innovations (custom decisions are still fine)
	* Added Tribal Kingdom/Empire shatter mechanic to model stateless societies (i.e., without social stratification innovation); enabled via rule

-----------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* TODO after Loup Returns:
	* Cleanup character history files to be more organized again (i.e., breakup all the extra new character files into existing ones and resort files)

* Unfixable Errors:
	* Building enable/disable states aren't checked at game start (so the Hellenic Parthenon is enabled for Christians in 476)
	* "Compiling source for  failed for missing arguments: LIEGE" - Can't find any missing "LIEGE" arguements

* Errors that don't block Alpha Release:
	* GFX:
		* c_grissons is all screwed up when clicking on it
	* Government issues (difficulty in reproduction):
		* Seem to be caused by chars not correctly inheriting government_ids...
		* Via abdication?
		* Inheritence by an unrelated char in formerly theocractic holdings?

* Errors:
	* Inform PDX that Windows paths in *.mod files aren't read correctly

* Other (Non-Blockers):
	* Write localization checking code (non-trivial)
	* Review various combinations of cultures and religions to ensure script values are good
		* None should be impossible, but many should be very difficult

=================================================================
Beta Notes:
=================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Code Base:
	* Merge the two government assign codes into a singular code path if possible. Otherwise, make sure they are in the same file for ease of maintenance

Known Vanilla Bugs in Error Log (as of v. 1.6.1.2):
=================================================================
	* Issues with portrait_fp2_iberian_muslim_clothing_trigger and related vanilla clothing triggers
	* Odoacer's victory not displaying correctly in GUI

=================================================================
Alpha Notes:
=================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Contentious Alpha Features (Will need Loup's review):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Culture:
	* Hepthalite, Xionite culture merged into Hunas for improved cultural accuracy
	* Writing now only spreads to adjacent cultures via can_progress trigger
	* Reduced number of heritages so that culture and heritage aren't as synonymous as before (476 cultures listed only):
		* Created Levantine heritage, merging Northwest and East Semitic:
			* Assyrian, Punic, Aramean
		* Replaced Central Semitic with Arabic and merged with South Semitic:
			* Adnantie, Nabatean, Yathribi, Himyarite, Sabaean, Minaean, Hadhramaut, Tribal Arab, Khalan
		* Created Coptic Heritage, related to Arabic and Levantine
			* Coptic
Religion:
	* Tengrism and Magyar Paganism are faiths of the same steppe religion
Governments:
	* Bureaucratic governments have non-capital containing titles revert to lieges on death (ala CK2 viceroys)
	* Gubernatorial governments don't have independence factions
	* Eranshar governments don't have independence factions if under e_persia
	* Liberty faction only applies to certian governments (those with player-modifiable laws)
Gameplay:
	* Added titular drift mechanic so titular titles can establish themselves
	* Prevent the creation of de jure kingdoms and empires without certain innovations (custom decisions are still fine)
	* Added Tribal Kingdom/Empire shatter mechanic to model stateless societies (i.e., without social stratification innovation); enabled via rule

-----------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* TODO after Loup Returns:
	* Cleanup character history files to be more organized again (i.e., breakup all the extra new character files into existing ones and resort files)

In Progress:
	* Add check to ensure effects and triggers are suffixed appropriately
	* Make regex collision checking a separate optional check
	* Change the check_database_items check to be run only during merge to main and required to pass for merge to main!

* Errors:
	* Inform PDX that Windows paths in *.mod files aren't read correctly
	* Vandals keep flipping to High Tribal Government?
	* GFX:
		* c_grissons is all screwed up when clicking on it
	* Government issues:
		* Related to usurpation of a single county by a landless character
		* Inheritence by an unrelated char in formerly theocractic holdings

* Major:
	* Flavorization and Localization
		* Fix collisions in name localizations
	* See if `replace_path` now works
	* Review common/on_actions/BP_title_on_actions.txt:BP_handle_bureaucratic_succession
* Minor:
	* Add kids of Athavulf that Sigeric killed
	* Map:
		* Change Tekman name
	* Government:
		* Foederati and Tributaries should get title loyalty?
	* GFX:
		* Religion icons aren't properly encoded; fix their encoding

Beta Notes:

While these rites were in doctrinal agreement with one another, it led to some noticable behavioral and structural differences between the many rites in the East and West.\n\nIn Spain, the Hispanic Rite (or Mozarbic Rite, as it would later be called) was one such rite. Because of the relative tolerance of the Visigoths, this rite developed in communion with Rome to the present day."

It retained a greater emphasis on penance and monasticism, and had many distinct features, such as a different formula for calculating the date of Easter."

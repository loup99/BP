Writers of the Roman Empire period referred to this mystery religion by phrases which can be anglicized as Mysteries of Mithras or Mysteries of the Persians. The mysteries were popular in the Roman military. Worshipers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Initiates called themselves syndexioi, those "united by the handshake". They met in underground temples, which survive in large numbers. The cult appears to have had its centre in Rome."

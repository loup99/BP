To simplify Vanilla Compatability, there's a list of alias in this mod.

All the maps are the form of database_key -> "ideal_key"

Aliases:
* coptic (faith) -> miaphysite
* north_african_religion -> berber_religion
* kushitism_religion -> egyptian_religion
* heritage_syriac -> heritage_levantine
* heritage_albanian -> heritage_proto_carpathian

		#### Minority Culture/Faith spread/growth/decline ####
		#=====================================================
		# Difference from "Cultural and Religious Minorities" is that we utilize quasi-cellular automata
		# rules similar to "Conway's Game of Life" to provide a marginally better model in which
		# cultures will not spread out overly far from existing concentrations of minorities.
		#
		#### How many minorities per county? ####
		#----------------------------------------
		# Every county can support minorities as a function of its development; We will utilize the Lucas
		# Sequence Vn(1,−1) [the Lucas Numbers, a series related to the Fibonacci sequence]
		#
		# 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76 ...
		#
		# 01: 1 minority
		# 04: 2 minorities
		# 07: 3 minorities
		# 11: 4 minorities
		# 18: 5 minorities
		# 29: 6 minorities
		# 47: 7 minorities
		# 76: 8 minorities
		#
		# NB: Each list of culture and faith minorities will be kept separate
		#
		# We will assign a "small" minority a size of 1 and a large minority a size of 2.
		#
		# So development (urbanization) allows for greater minority presence.
		#
		#### How do minorities disappear? ####
		#-------------------------------------
		# So long as the number of minorities do not exceed the development limits, the minorities should
		# not disappear (think the various "relic" populations in various locales). Once this limit is
		# exceeded, then we need to determine which minorities are being "fed"
		#
		#### Which minority disappears first? ####
		#-----------------------------------------
		# To determine which minority disappears, we will determine which are being "fed" from
		# adjoining counties.
		# * A minority population is always "fed" if it is next to a county where it is a majority
		#   population.
		# * A minority population is fed if it has enough support.
		# * Large minorities require at least 4 points of adjoining minorities
		#    * Adjoining large minorities are worth 2
		# * Small minorities require at least 2 points of adjoining minorities
		#    * Adjoining small minorities are worth 1
		# * Any minority that is underfed is at risk of disappearing.
		#
		# NB: Certain traditions (like Diasporic) and doctrines should imply a sorting within the underfed
		# population. Diasporic Jewish populations long established themselves in Europe and Asia after
		# all.
		#
		#### How do minorities spread? ####
		#----------------------------------
		# When a county has fewer minorities than its capacity, it should randomly get a minority from an
		# adjoining county. For now, let the selection be truly random.

#Oksywie Group: 200 BC to AD 100
#The Oksywie Group are cultures that formed contemporaneously with the Przeworsk group, from the
# IInd Century BC to the Ist Century AD. They were likely the first casualties of the Gothic Expansion,
# and should be related-to-but separate from Przeworsk, although notably linked to the West Balts.
#
# Both the Gustow and Rygir are heavily more Germanized than the original Oksywie by the Vth Century.
# It should still reflect Baltic influence in its COAs and fashion.

# Gustow:
# Explicit reference to the Gustow Archaeological Group. Probably branched from the Oksywie Culture and
# was at least partially influenced by both East and Central Germanic cultures. Presuming the Rugii were
# the elite portion expelled by the proto-Goths when they landed on the Baltic coast and formed the early
# Wielbark culture. By the Vth Century, represents the tail end of the Oskywie peoples who merged with
# Elbe groups, which is why it speaks Elbe Germanic.

# Skirian:
# The Sciri remain a constant mystery. They are very early attested but pop in and out of history,
# starting in the IInd Century BC with some raids, but they only are really clearly attested around 300 AD. 
# Given their links to the Bastarnae, I suspect the “Pure/Bastard” distinction might hold weight, with
# the Sciri being an unmixed people. On the other hand, Odovacar’s father being a Hun undercuts that a
# bit. If we are calling the Heruli the inheritors of the Bastarnae, then maybe this still works out well.
#
#I personally suspect they were some otherwise less mixed group that readily admixed under pressure and
# competition with the better attested Bastarnae. Since they would be in the same area as the Chernyakhov,
# I see no reason not to let them be Gothic speakers (or at least, whatever East Germanic they spoke
# became Gothic enough for game mechanics during the Chernyakhov times).
#
# So with that in mind, I think making them essentially the original East Germans of the Pomeranian
# Culture [along with the Bastarnae] (Pommeranian culture itself was likely a successor of the
# non-Germanic Lusatian culture); some proposals for the evolution of Germanic languages have it in
# the mouth of the Vistula ca. 500 BC, which would align roughly with the decline of the Lusatian culture
# and the rise of Pommeranian. Further Germanization probably occurred during the Chernyakhov period.
# Their innate conservativeness means they’ll use Northern Equipment instead of Norse or Continental.

#Przeworsk Group: 300 BC to AD 500
# This culture spanned from Vth Century BC to the Vth Century AD and was tied to the Vandals and
# (possibly) the Burgundians. Przeworsk had some clear Germanic features but also inputs from Baltic
# and Slavic groups, with a Genetic link to later West Slavs [A]. So as the Vandals and Burgundians
# represent elite groups that left/were forced to leave, while Przeworsk (by the mid-IVth Century) more
# represents the peasant culture.
#
# So, ethnically, Przeworsk is a strong mix of groups, while Vandalic and Burgundians are much more
# Germanic (and primarily Germanic instead of Norse, with Jastorf being the contributor initially).

#Gepid:
#The Gepids remain relatively mysterious, but we have two primary anchors:  the Gepids are referenced in

# they probably originated from the upper Dniester lands.
#
# I suspect, based on the fact that the Gepids became a steadfast force for the Huns, that they were
# likely ruled over previously by the Vandals, possibly as an admixture of the Victohali and Agaragantes
# who were defeated just before the Gepids entered the direct written historical record. Genetics points
# to a Wielbark and Langobard [B], but the grave is from the VIth century. So probably Wielbark
# inheritance, at least for the elite.
#
# Given Jordanes listing them as Goths and their proximity to the core Gothic civilization, I’m inclined
# to make them Gothic speakers, but not directly related to Goths (sister cultures). They are probably
# an amalgam of peoples of the Carpathian Plain, which would explain their sudden rise as the
# Vandals fled (and reports of Gepids as part of the Vandals migration to Spain).

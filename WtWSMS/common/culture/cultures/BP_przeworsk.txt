#Oksywie Group: 200 BC to AD 100
#The Oksywie Group are cultures that formed contemporaneously with the Przeworsk group, from the
# IInd Century BC to the Ist Century AD. They were likely the first casualties of the Gothic Expansion,
# and should be related-to-but separate from Przeworsk, although notably linked to the West Balts.
#
# Both the Gustow and Rygir are heavily more Germanized than the original Oksywie by the Vth Century.
# It should still reflect Baltic influence in its COAs and fashion.

# Gustow:
# Explicit reference to the Gustow Archaeological Group. Probably branched from the Oksywie Culture and
# was at least partially influenced by both East and Central Germanic cultures. Presuming the Rugii were
# the elite portion expelled by the proto-Goths when they landed on the Baltic coast and formed the early
# Wielbark culture. By the Vth Century, represents the tail end of the Oskywie peoples who merged with
# Elbe groups, which is why it speaks Elbe Germanic.

#Przeworsk Group: 300 BC to AD 500
# This culture spanned from Vth Century BC to the Vth Century AD and was tied to the Vandals and
# (possibly) the Burgundians. Przeworsk had some clear Germanic features but also inputs from Baltic
# and Slavic groups, with a Genetic link to later West Slavs [A]. So as the Vandals and Burgundians
# represent elite groups that left/were forced to leave, while Przeworsk (by the mid-IVth Century) more
# represents the peasant culture.
#
# So, ethnically, Przeworsk is a strong mix of groups, while Vandalic and Burgundians are much more
# Germanic (and primarily Germanic instead of Norse, with Jastorf being the contributor initially).

#Gepid:
#The Gepids remain relatively mysterious, but we have two primary anchors:  the Gepids are referenced in
# Getica as a Gothic people, but they are only definitively linked to the area of the Tisza or Koros
# rivers. If Jordanes is accurate in his descriptions of the Gepids as being from “rugged mountains”,
# they probably originated from the upper Dniester lands.
#
# I suspect, based on the fact that the Gepids became a steadfast force for the Huns, that they were
# likely ruled over previously by the Vandals, possibly as an admixture of the Victohali and Agaragantes
# who were defeated just before the Gepids entered the direct written historical record. Genetics points
# to a Wielbark and Langobard [B], but the grave is from the VIth century. So probably Wielbark
# inheritance, at least for the elite.
#
# Given Jordanes listing them as Goths and their proximity to the core Gothic civilization, I’m inclined
# to make them Gothic speakers, but not directly related to Goths (sister cultures). They are probably
# an amalgam of peoples of the Carpathian Plain, which would explain their sudden rise as the
# Vandals fled (and reports of Gepids as part of the Vandals migration to Spain).
#
# Get Recognition of Talent to replace Loyal Subjects (seems more fitting).

#Chernyakhov Group: AD 100 to AD 400
#
# This group is associated with the Goths and Slavs and Sarmatians. I suspect it was a multi-ethnic
# conglomeration that was dominated by the Goths in part or mostly. The later groups that fought for
# the Huns (Heruli, Slavs, Gepids, &c.) were probably dominated by them until the Huns arrived and broke
# everything.

# Heruli
# The Heruli appear more-or-less contemporaneously with the Goths in the historical record, possibly as a
# branch of the Germanics living near the Pontic Steppe in the late IVth Century. Beyond that, we don’t
# have much. The large presence of non-Germanic names [7] makes me think it was either a Germanic elite
# with large non-Germanic components or an admixed Germanic group. For flavor, I’m planning the later
# (maybe the remnant Bastarnae?), so it’ll have a mix of Germanic and Dacian/Sarmatian aesthetics.

# Skirian:
# The Sciri remain a constant mystery. They are very early attested but pop in and out of history,
# starting in the IInd Century BC with some raids, but they only are really clearly attested around 300 AD. 
# Given their links to the Bastarnae, I suspect the “Pure/Bastard” distinction might hold weight, with
# the Sciri being an unmixed people. On the other hand, Odovacar’s father being a Hun undercuts that a
# bit. If we are calling the Heruli the inheritors of the Bastarnae, then maybe this still works out well.
#
#I personally suspect they were some otherwise less mixed group that readily admixed under pressure and
# competition with the better attested Bastarnae. Since they would be in the same area as the Chernyakhov,
# I see no reason not to let them be Gothic speakers (or at least, whatever East Germanic they spoke
# became Gothic enough for game mechanics during the Chernyakhov times).
#
# So with that in mind, I think making them essentially the original East Germans of the Pomeranian
# Culture [along with the Bastarnae] (Pommeranian culture itself was likely a successor of the
# non-Germanic Lusatian culture); some proposals for the evolution of Germanic languages have it in
# the mouth of the Vistula ca. 500 BC, which would align roughly with the decline of the Lusatian culture
# and the rise of Pommeranian. Further Germanization probably occurred during the Chernyakhov period.
# Their innate conservativeness means they’ll use Northern Equipment instead of Norse or Continental.
#
# Still Gothic heritage because they really came into history from Chernyakhov

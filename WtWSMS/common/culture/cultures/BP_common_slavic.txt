#Notes:
#[1] - From what I've read of proto-Slavic groups, they were fairly settled and had, at most, a relatively
# flat social structure, with social stratification occurring when population density increased. Collective
# lands seems to be the "best fit" for this notion of a flat hierarchy, review evolution for 0.2.0

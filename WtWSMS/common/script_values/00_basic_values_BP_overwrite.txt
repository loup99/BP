##### Changed from Vanilla: Gubernatorials never factor in obligations

# Requires changed_obligations list to be set for contract obligations
# This = Person who's obligation we are checking
count_obligation_improvements_for_vassal = {
	value = 0

	save_temporary_scope_as = vassal

	every_in_list = {
		list = changed_obligations

		vassal_contract_type = {
			save_temporary_scope_as = contract_type
		}

		add = {
			value = obligation_level_score
			subtract = "scope:vassal.vassal_contract_obligation_level_score( scope:contract_type )"
		}
	}
	##### Changed from Vanilla vvvvv
	if = {
		limit = { this = { has_government = gubernatorial_government } }
		multiply = 0

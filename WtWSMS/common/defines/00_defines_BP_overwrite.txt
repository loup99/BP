##### Changed from Vanilla: Changed First Era Start Year, DEFAULT_MAX_TRADITIONS values, tweaked culture acceptance rates
NCulture = {
	FIRST_ERA_START_YEAR = -1000 # When did the first era start?
	DEFAULT_MAX_TRADITIONS = 3 # How many traditions can a culture have by default?
	#Culture acceptance overhaul
	
	# This counts the # of border counties. So if culture A has a county that borders a single county of culture B, that's 2 border counties. If it bordered 2, it'd be 3 border counties, as each individual county can only get counted once
	YEARLY_ACCEPTANCE_PER_BORDER_COUNTY = 0.02 #(Halved round _down_)
	MAX_YEARLY_ACCEPTANCE_PER_BORDER_COUNTY = 1
	MAX_ACCEPTANCE_FROM_SHARED_REALMS = 0.25 # (Halved) If 100% of both cultures are in the same realm, acceptance will increase by this much each year. For each realm with both cultures we take the % of each culture that's present in the realm and multiply them with one another. E.G., if a realm has 50% of all Norwegian counties and 40% of all Swedish cultures, that'll contribute 50% * 40% * MAX_ACCEPTANCE_FROM_SHARED_REALMS to acceptance each year
	# Acceptance per year per vassal of each tier
	# This is then divided by the size of the smaller of the two cultures, or by MIN_CULTURE_SIZE_FOR_VASSAL_ACCEPTANCE if that's bigger
	# So a king vassal gives the same gain for a small culture as two king vassals for one that's twice as big
	# We don't support baron vassals for this
	YEARLY_ACCEPTANCE_FROM_TIER = { 0 0 1 2 5 0 } #(Halved round up)
	MAX_YEARLY_ACCEPTANCE_FROM_VASSALS = 0.25 # (Halved) We don't give more than this from vassalage
	MIN_CULTURE_SIZE_FOR_VASSAL_ACCEPTANCE = 5 # We pretend neither culture involved is smaller than this
	ACCEPTANCE_REDUCTION_FROM_NO_INTERACTION = 0.5 # If two cultures gain no acceptance at all from bordering, vassals, or shared realm, their acceptance will go down by this amount each year. Cultures with the same heritage are exempt
	ACCEPTANCE_REGRESSION_TOWARDS_BASELINE = 1 # At 100% past the baseline it ticks down at this rate per year. Scaled from 0 to 100%, so at 50% it'd be half this value
	MIN_ACCEPTANCE_REGRESSION_TOWARDS_BASELINE = 0.1 # Regression towards zero can't go below this (except to avoid overshooting the baseline)
	ACCEPTANCE_DIMINISHING_RETURNS = 0.5 # At 100%, increases are reduced by this much. Scaled from 0 to 100%, ignores baseline
}

##### Changed from Vanilla: Changed MAA starting stuff
NCharacter = {
	# Note that when mixing prestige and gold MaA, it'll stop buying more once one reaches the goal
	# By spending, we mean that it'll try to match the maintenance when unraised and fully reinforced to this portion of their monthly balance
	# Newly landed rulers (except those that should inherit MaA if they're landed by inheritance) also get MaA based on this
	MAA_STARTING_EXPENSE_MIN = 0.750 # Rulers at game start will start out spending this much (or a bit more, as it'll overshoot) on men at arms
	MAA_STARTING_EXPENSE_MAX = 0.900 # Rulers will never start out spending more than this on men at arms. For poor rulers this can mean they end up under MAA_STARTING_EXPENSE_MIN if one more MaA would put them above the max
	MAA_STARTING_PRESTIGE_EXPENSE_MIN = 0.4 # Rulers at game start will start out spending this much prestige (or a bit more, as it'll overshoot) on men at arms
	MAA_STARTING_PRESTIGE_EXPENSE_MAX = 0.55 # Rulers will never start out spending more than this much prestige on men at arms. For prestige-poor rulers this can mean they end up under MAA_STARTING_PRESTIGE_EXPENSE_MIN if one more MaA would put them above the max

##### Changed from Vanilla: Changed First Era Start Year, DEFAULT_MAX_TRADITIONS values
NCulture = {
	FIRST_ERA_START_YEAR = -1000 # When did the first era start?
	DEFAULT_MAX_TRADITIONS = 3 # How many traditions can a culture have by default?
}

##### Changed from Vanilla: Changed MAA starting stuff
NCharacter = {
	# Note that when mixing prestige and gold MaA, it'll stop buying more once one reaches the goal
	# By spending, we mean that it'll try to match the maintenance when unraised and fully reinforced to this portion of their monthly balance
	# Newly landed rulers (except those that should inherit MaA if they're landed by inheritance) also get MaA based on this
	MAA_STARTING_EXPENSE_MIN = 0.750 # Rulers at game start will start out spending this much (or a bit more, as it'll overshoot) on men at arms
	MAA_STARTING_EXPENSE_MAX = 0.900 # Rulers will never start out spending more than this on men at arms. For poor rulers this can mean they end up under MAA_STARTING_EXPENSE_MIN if one more MaA would put them above the max
	MAA_STARTING_PRESTIGE_EXPENSE_MIN = 0.4 # Rulers at game start will start out spending this much prestige (or a bit more, as it'll overshoot) on men at arms
	MAA_STARTING_PRESTIGE_EXPENSE_MAX = 0.55 # Rulers will never start out spending more than this much prestige on men at arms. For prestige-poor rulers this can mean they end up under MAA_STARTING_PRESTIGE_EXPENSE_MIN if one more MaA would put them above the max

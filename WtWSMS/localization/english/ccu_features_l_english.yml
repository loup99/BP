 game_concept_heritages: "Heritages"
 
 game_concept_heritage_family: "Heritage Family"
 game_concept_heritage_families: "Heritage Families"
 game_concept_heritage_family_desc: "Heritage families are groupings of related [heritages|E]. A shared heritage family increases [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline."
 
 game_concept_heritage_group: "Heritage Group"
 game_concept_heritage_groups: "Heritage Groups"
 game_concept_heritage_group_desc: "Heritage Groups are groupings of related [heritages|E]. A shared heritage group increases [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline."

 game_concept_kulturbund: "$game_concept_heritage_kulturbund$"
 game_concept_heritage_kulturbunds: "Kulturbunds"
 game_concept_heritage_kulturbund_desc: "Heritage #italic Kulturbunds#! are associations of heritages that, while distinct, have a very large number of similarities (e.g., Turco-Mongol cultures). A shared #italic Kulturbund#! increases [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline."
 
 game_concept_language_group: "Language Group"
 game_concept_language_groups: "Language Groups"
 game_concept_language_group_desc: "Language Groups are groupings of related [languages|E]. A shared language group increases [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline, and it is easier to learn a language in the same group as your [culture|E]'s."
 
 game_concept_language_branch: "Language Branch"
 game_concept_language_branches: "Language Branches"
 game_concept_language_branch_desc: "Language Branches are groupings of related [languages|E]. A shared language branch increases [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline, and it is easier to learn a language in the same branch as your [culture|E]'s."
 
 game_concept_language_family: "Language Family"
 game_concept_language_families: "Language Families"
 game_concept_language_family_desc: "language Families are groupings of related [language_branches|E]. A shared language family increases [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline, and it is easier to learn a language in the same family as your [culture|E]'s."
 
 game_concept_language_union: "Language Union"
 game_concept_language_unions: "Language Unions"
 game_concept_language_union_desc: "Language Unions are sprachbunds of genetically unrelated [languages|E]. A shared language union increases [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline, and it is easier to learn a language in the same union as your [culture|E]'s."
 
 game_concept_language_dialect_continuum: "Dialect Continuum"
 game_concept_language_dialect_continuum_desc: "Dialect Continuum represent languages that are related and mutually intelligible, but may not be intelligible to other languages within the same [language_branch|E]"
 game_concept_dialect_continuum: "Dialect Continuum"
 
 game_concept_language_creole: "Creole"
 game_concept_language_creole_desc: "Creole languages are stable natural languages that develop from simplification and mixing of two different languages into a new one in a fairly brief period of time. As such, they remain somewhat intelligible to some otherwise genetically unrelated languages."
 game_concept_creole: "Creole"

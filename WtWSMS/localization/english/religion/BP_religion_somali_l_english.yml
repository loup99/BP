 somali_religion_desc: "The pre-Axumite beliefs of Ethiopia bore heavy resemblances with the religion of Southern Arabia, reflecting the very real legacy of political, cultural, and commercial exchange in the Red Sea and Horn of Africa area. These deities include Meder and Beher, chthonic earth deities, as well as Hawbas, a moon deity also worshiped in Southern Arabia. The continuation of the cult of Astar, a non-Arabian deity dating to ancient Ethiopia, is also evident. Above all these deities is Mahrem-Ares, a War deity and supreme lord of the astral and chthonic. Ancestor worship and animal sacrifice were also practiced, with divine rights reflecting the pastoral agricultural basis of these societies."

 assyrian_religion_desc: "Originating from the city state of Assur, the Ashurian faith would spread across Egypt, Babylon and Anatolia following the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 10th Century BC. The Ashurians worshipped the god Ashur chiefly but also worshipped other Mesopotamian deities and spirits, as well as personal 'guardian spirits' assigned to individuals by the gods. The King of Assyria is believed to be mortal servant of Ashur sent to enact his will on earth. In Assyrian mythology it is said that if the Assyrians were to stop conquering the world would be brought to an end."

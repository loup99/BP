 mozarabic_church_desc: "The Early Christian Church did not have the same precise rubrics seen in later centuries, and a number of concurrent rites developed across the Roman Empire. While these rites were in doctrinal agreement with one another, it led to some noticeable behavioural and structural differences between the many rites in the East and West.\n\nIn Spain, the Hispanic Rite (or Mozarabic Rite, as it would later be called) was one such rite. Because of the relative tolerance of the Visigoths, this rite developed in communion with Rome to the present day."

 nestorian: "East Syriac Church"
 nestorian_adj: "Eastern Syriac"
 nestorian_adherent: "Eastern Syriac"
 nestorian_adherent_plural: "Eastern Syriacs"
 nestorian_desc: "One of the most divisive issues of the Early Christian Church centred on the nature of Christ and his relation to the Father. In Persia and Mesopotamia, the Syriac-speaking church utilized the dyophysite formulation that #EMP the human and divine #italic qnome#! of Christ are unmixed but eternally united in his #italic parsopa#!#!. The use of these Syriac terms, which did not map precisely to the Greek #italic physis#! (nature) and #italic hypostasis#! (person), along with the growing political divide between Christians in Persia and Rome, led to the schism between the East Syriac Church from the Roman Church in AD 431. It eventually garnered followers as far east as China, India, and even Mongolia."

 priscillianism_religious_text: "The Priscillianist Canon"
 priscillianism_religious_head_title: "Pope"
 priscillianism_religious_head_title_name: "See of Avila"
 priscillianism_desc: "The foundation of the doctrines of the Priscillianists was Gnostic-Manichaean dualism, a belief in the existence of two kingdoms, one of Light and one of Darkness. Angels and the souls of men were said to be severed from the substance of the Deity. Human souls were intended to conquer the Kingdom of Darkness, but fell and were imprisoned in material bodies. Thus both kingdoms were represented in man, and hence a conflict symbolized on the side of Light by the Twelve Patriarchs, heavenly spirits, who corresponded to certain of man's powers, and on the side of Darkness by the Signs of the Zodiac, the symbols of matter and the lower kingdom. The salvation of man consists in liberation from the domination of matter. The twelve heavenly spirits having failed to accomplish their release, the Saviour came in a heavenly body which appeared to be like that of other men, and through His doctrine and His apparent death released the souls of the men from the influence of earthly matter."
 
 #Miaphysitism 
 coptic: "Miaphysitism"
 coptic_adj: "Miaphysite"
 coptic_adherent: "Miaphysite"
 coptic_adherent_plural: "Miaphysites"
 coptic_desc: "Miaphysite Christianity encompasses the Coptic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church. Miaphysites stress that Christ had but a single nature, but of both human and divine character. This stance split them off from the main branch of Christianity after the council of Chalcedon in 451. Though not viewed as outright heretics by Chalcedonian Christians, it is a fine distinction. The nominal head of the Miaphysite Church is the Pope of Alexandria."

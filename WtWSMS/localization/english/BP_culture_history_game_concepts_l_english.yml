 game_concept_romano_alan_formation_year_desc: "In AD 406, large group of Vandals, Alans, and Suebi crossed the Rhine, ushering in drastic changes to Roman rule in Gaul and Hispania and contributing to the eventual collapse of the Western Empire. The bulk of the Alans followed the Alan #italic Rex#! Respindal #P ([Concept('plre_vol_2_respindal','1')|I])#!, but another group followed the #italic Rex#! Goar #P ([Concept('plre_vol_2_goar','2')|I])#!. Goar's smaller band joined forces with the Romans and were eventually settled in Armorica. These Alans probably added Romanized Sarmatian #italic laeti#! in Gaul to their ranks, and eventually formed a small polity in #italic civitas Aurelianorum#!, modern Orleans.\n\n#bold Because technology is closely tied to culture in CK3, we have had to split the Alans in Orleans into a different culture from the remaining Alans north of the Caucasus.#!\n\nThis choice was done to reflect the game mechanics, not necessarily endorsing the idea that the Alans in Orleans were culturally different from their tribal brethren."

This kingdom was short-lived, and after the death of Attaces, the Alans amalgamated with the Vandals #P ([Concept('plre_vol_2_addac','2')|I])#!.

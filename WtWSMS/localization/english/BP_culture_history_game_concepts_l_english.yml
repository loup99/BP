 game_concept_archeological_complex_desc: "\"In archaeology, a complex is a chronological subdivision of different artefact types such as stone tools, pottery, and the like.

 game_concept_qatarye_historical_evolution: "History of Qatar"
 game_concept_qatarye_historical_evolution_desc: "The history of Qatar between the fall of Dilmun and the rise of Persia is poorly documented. What is clear is under the Parthians and especially the Sassanids, the region became a significant commercial center again. Based on Syriac records about Beth Qatraye (i.e., \"region of the Qataris\"), the region became a significant center of Christianity as well.\n\nAs such, we choose to represent the siginficantly different cultural practices of the Arabic people region with a separate culture $controversy_short_note$. The Qatarye culture still is an Arabic heritage, Arabic speaking people."
 #Berbers
 game_concept_proto_north_berber_culture: "Early Northern Amazigh Peoples"
 game_concept_proto_north_berber_culture_desc: "The history of the early Amazigh peoples in what is today Tunisia and Mauritania is poorly documented, not the least of which is that the names and tribal affiliations for these groups were extremely fluid and broad (i.e., the Romans used the names Numidian, Gaetulian, and Mauri for a broad range of people, both nomadic and sedentary, across Northwestern Africa across multiple centuries). Compounding the issue is that the sedentary and nomadic groups would readily flow into and out of each other, depending on the location.\n\nAs such, the separation of the Northwestern Amazigh is a product of the limitations in the game mechanics - specifically the tying of technology, culture, and holding control in an intimate way - whereas they would have had a much more fluid identity.\n\n#bold For mechanical purposes, we make the $gaetulian$ culture the parent culture of the $mauri_collective_noun$ and $numidian_collective_noun$, to represent the connectedness of the various Amazigh cultures in Northwest Africa $controversy_short_note$.#!"
 game_concept_numidian_notes: "The Numidians"
 game_concept_numidian_notes_desc: "The Numidians were an Amazigh people who has extensive contact with the Punics and eventually formed a sizable polity under the reign of Masinissa in the late IInd Century BC, encompassing most of what would later be Roman Mauritania and Tripolis. The polity had some significant influence from the Punics, most notably the adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet for its own language. The polity was extensively settled, with a sizable agricultural sector and the Numidians themselves were noted as excellent cavalrymen. Numidia and Mauritania were eventually conquered by Rome in the Ist Century AD, ushering in an era of Roman influence.\n\nUnfortnuately, the Numidian language remains poorly attested, and is only guessed to be either a branch of the Amazigh languages or the antecedant to the late antique Amazigh languages.\n\n For the purposes of $wtwsms_italic$, we presume that the Numidians spoke a Northern Berber language, like the later Amazigh tribes in the same region do $controversy_short_note$. As Numidia was an agricultural powerhouse, we model it as a culture that encompasses both transhumance and sedentary agriculture $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_mauretanian_identity: "The Amazigh under Roman Rule"
 game_concept_mauretanian_identity_desc: "The Amazigh identity remained present throughout the period of Roman rule and Africa and Mauritania underwent a different process of Romanization than the was seen in, say, southern Hispania or Southern Gaul. The urban and coastal cores underwent extensive Romanization and were viewed as Roman, but the agricultural hinterland was far less affected, which led to a variety of post-Roman Amazigh polities being established following the collapse of Roman rule during the Vandal Conquest in the middle of the Vth Century.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model this complexity by making the Amazigh peoples who were under extensive Roman control a hybrid culture of Romano-African and Numidian, while retaining an Amazigh heritage and language $controversy_short_note$. This prevents hybridization with Romano-African while maintaining a core Amazigh identity.\n\nAs was noted in \"[proto_north_berber_culture|E]\", the Romans used a variety of names for the aboriginal inhabitants of Numida and Mauritania. As Mauri was clearly used for both the independent tribes beyond Roman control in Mauritania, that name cannot be used for this separate, Numidian-derived culture. As such, we've used the name #italic Mauretanian#!, a general term for the Amazigh in and around Roman control. This is not to say that the #italic Mauretanians#! were necessarily a separate people from those beyond Roman control, but it enables us to better match certain game mechanics $controversy_short_note$."

 game_concept_rhaetian_culture: "Rhaetian Culture"
 game_concept_rhaetian_culture_desc: "The Rhaeti were a confederation of Alpine tribes related to the Etruscans, whose name lent itself to the Roman province of Raetia. The Rhaeti language itself may have been spoken as late as the IIIrd Century AD, but by the Ist Century BC, the process of language death was already well underway.\n\nBy the Vth Century AD, Romanization was complete, and the last of the Tyrsenian languages was dead."

 game_concept_paleo_sardinian_culture: "Nuragic Culture"
 game_concept_paleo_sardinian_culture_desc: "The pre-Roman peoples of Sardinian, also known as Nuragic Culture, named after the Nuraghe structures they left behind. The culture existed on Sardinia from at least the XVIIIth Century BC until the Roman Conquest in 238 BC (and possibly until the VIth Century AD in the Barbagia region of Sardinia). While the culture left few written records, extensive material evidence remains of the later Nuragic tribes, the Balares and the Iliensis, as well as records left by surrounding civilizations.\n\nFollowing the Roman Conquest, the islands had considerable settlement from Italy and extensive Romanization, although some tribes, such as the Parati, Sossinati, Balari, and Aconites remained outside Roman control into Imperial times #P ([Concept('strabo_source','1')|I])#! and resisted Christianization until the late VIth Century AD, when Pope Gregory I sent a mission to convert Hospito's tribe in Barbagia."

 game_concept_paleo_corsican_culture_desc: "The Corsi are the pre-Roman people of Corisca (and northern Sardinia) who lived on the island prior to the Roman conquest. While ancient authors connect the to either the Ligurians or Etruscans, their actual identification remains a mystery.\n\nThey were possibly related to the Bronze Age Torrean Civilization in Southern Corsica, but the limited evidence prevents any substantial conclusion."
 game_concept_paleo_iberian_culture: "Paleo-Iberian Cultures"
 game_concept_paleo_iberian_culture_desc: "Prior to the Roman Conquest, Iberia contained a number of different cultures that were later subsumed into the Romanized population of the Iberian Peninsula. Among them are:\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The #italic Hispani#! of coastal Hispania Citerior, Hispania Tarraconensis, and Hispania Ulterior, whose language is unclassified and was extinct by the IInd Century AD.

Noted warriors, these groups resisted Romanization and maintained an independent identity until at least the Ist Century AD, and in the case of the Lusitani, probably until the Vth.\n\nThe Romano-Hispanic culture is a combination of these influences as well as Roman culture."
 #Caucasian Cultures
 game_concept_corudenian_culture: "The Corduenians"
 game_concept_corudenian_culture_desc: "The Corduenians (or Carduchoi, Korduk', Gordyene, or Gortyene) are a poorly attested people that lived between Lake Van and Adiabene in Late Antiquity (and are attested into at least the VIIth Century AD).\n\nTheir precise origins are unknown, and debate remains as per their relation with other groups; some support a Kurdish connection and others refute it #P ([Concept('corudenian_source_1','1')|I])#!, others an Armenian connection, and still others a potential Iranian, or Gutian, or Uratuian connection.

 game_concept_balaskan_culture: "Balaskan Culture"
 game_concept_balaskan_culture_desc: "The cultural makeup of the region that would be known as Balaskan is sparsely attested. It is known that a (likely) Caucasian peoples referred to as the Caspians (#italic Káspioi#! in Greek and #italic Kaspk'#! in Armenian) inhabited the region through the Achaemenid period, but by the IInd Century were extinct #P ([Concept('strabo_caspian_source','1')])#!. The region was then most likely a hodgepodge of Iranic, Aghwan, and Armenian peoples #P ([Concept('paytakaran_source','2')])#!.\n\nThe extents of Balasagan (or Balasakan in Armenian) is also somehwat fuzzy, but likely included the Mugan Plain and what is today the Shirvan region. By the Late Antique period, the actual identity of the people in the region is somewhat unclear; Shapur I referred to the region as Iranian in his conquests, but Kartir would later refer to them as un-Iranian. During the Armenian rebellion of 450-1, the King of Balasgan would fight against the Christian Armenians but would in turn revolt against the Persians, raising questions of orientation. Furthermore, there are references to Balasgan being related to the Caucasian Albanians, at least before the Peace of 387.\n\nThis conundrum leaves the rather prosperous and valuable Balaskan region in somewhat of a quandary. As a means of resolving these historical discrepancies, we make Balasgan culture a mix of Aghwan and Adhari, using the Adhari ethos and language, but retaining a Caucasian heritage. This mixture should, in part, justify the confusing identification of Balsagan as both belonging to and #bold not#! belonging to Iran, in the sense that Kartir and Shapur I would use the terms $controversy_short_note$. The choice of Adhari is in line with the notion that Old Azeri, which spanned the region of modern Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan, was a Northwestern Iranic language, part of the same continuum as Adhari in $wtwsms_italic$ $controversy_short_note$."

 game_concept_lusitanian_culture_desc: "The precise ethnic identity of the #italic Lusitani#! is a matter of debate; scholars have posited a para-Celtic, Italic, or a separate branch from Italo-Celtic.\n\nWithin $wtwsms_italic$, the Lusitanian culture represents the Celticized and Romanized descendents of the original #italic Lusitani#! peoples."
 #Greek Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_phocaea_culture: "Ionian Culture"
 game_concept_phocaea_culture_desc: "The Ionians were one of the four major subdivisions of Greeks in the ancient period; others included Dorians, Aeolians, and Achaeans. Because of their small numbers and the extended period that the Massalians have had under Roman domination, the Massalians speak Latin like the surrounding groups by the Vth Century AD."
 #Iranian Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_brahui_culture: "Brahui Ethnogeneis"
 game_concept_brahui_culture_desc: "The existence of the Dravidian-speaking Brahui within a larger population of Indo-Iranian speaking peoples is a mystery. Some scholars posit the Brahui were part of a migration to the region (sometime within the last 3 millennia #P ([Concept('brahui_source_iranica','1')|I])#!)#!, while others argue that the Brahui represent a relic population, considering no significant genetic difference between the Brahui and their Indo-Iranian neighbours #P ([Concept('brahui_source_genetics','2')|I])#!)#!.\n\n#bold Within $wtwsms_italic$, we choose to model the Brahui as a relic population and as such, the Brahui are an Iranian heritage culture $controversy_short_note$, which matches their own self-identification as Balochs #P ([Concept('brahui_source_iranica','1')|I])#!)#!."
 game_concept_paleo_azeri_culture: "Paleo-Atropatene Cultures"
 game_concept_paleo_azeri_culture_desc: "The region known as Media Atropatene (or Iranian Azerbaijan in modern parlance) is a historical region in modern Northwest Iran. Historically, the region contained a number of different peoples prior to the conquest by the Medes in 609 BC. These include:\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The Matiene, a kingdom whose population possibly spoke a Hurro-Uratian language. Because of the Scythian and Cimmerian migrations, influences from Eastern Iranian speaking peoples cannot be ruled out.\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$Caspians, a possibly pre-Indo-European people who lived south of the Araxes River.\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$Cyrtians, a nomadic group of potentially Iranian or non-Iranian ancestry (or both), who lived in the Zagros Mountains.\n\nAfter the conquest of Media by the Achaemenid Empire, the region, the region underwent extensive Iranianization.

 game_concept_paleo_cyrtian_culture_desc: "A number of non-Iranian nomadic groups lived in the Zagros Mountains during Antiquity, including the Uxii, Cyrtians, Lullubi, and Gutians. By the Vth Century AD, these groups had been under the process of Iranianization for several centuries and this process was either complete or nearing completion.\n\nBecause of the restrictions of game mechanics and the general lack of firm data, we group all these people together as Crytians and made them an Iranian speaking, Iranian heritage culture."
 game_concept_proto_sistani_culture: "Origin of the Eastern Persians"
 game_concept_proto_sistani_culture_desc: "The Eastern Persian dialects, such as Dari, Aimaq, and Tajik, evolved from the earlier Middle Persian language spoken throughout the Sasanid Empire. During the Middle Persian period, settlement of what is now Greater Khorosan by Persian settlers were beginning and contributed to the eventual spread of New Persian and the displacement of Eastern Iranian languages in Central Asia (excluding the dialects of Pashto and the the remnant of Sogdian, Yaghnobi).\n\nThe population of Sakastan were originally Drangianans, an East Iranian people. With the influx of the Saka and Parthians from the IInd Century BC to the Ist Century AD, the name of the region changed to Sakastan, or #italic Seyansih#! in Middle Persian.\n\nBecause of the limitations of game mechanics, in $wtwsms_italic$, we model this complicated process by making $sistani$ a Bactrian-Persian Hybrid, as the Pasthuns are likely the closet related culture to the original Drangianans $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_proto_med_culture: "Origin of the Med People"
 game_concept_proto_med_culture_desc: "The origin of the Med people, the indigenous fisherman in coastal Makran, is not known for certain. They are likely related to the #italic Ichthyophagi#! mentioned by Arrian as part of Alexander's return to Babylon $controversy_short_note$, although this remains uncertain. What is known is that by the VIIth Century AD, the Meds were a piratical force to be reckoned with, whose actions eventually provided the Umayyad's with a justification for the conquest of Sindh.\n\nThe precise ethnic and linguistic identification of the Meds is very uncertain, but given the fact that Turan and Makran had significant Indian influences up to the Muslim conquest, we have elected to make the Med people an Indo-Aryan heritage and Paishachi Prakrit speaking culture in $wtwsms_italic$ $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_proto_baloch_culture: "History of Balochistan"
 game_concept_proto_baloch_culture_desc: "The pre-Islamic history of Balochistan is very poorly documented, with significant gaps in the historical record. The ethogenesis of the modern Baloch people occurred after the arrival of Islam #P ([Concept('dranganian_source_1','1')|I])#!, and Baluch lore argues for an Arab ethogenesis, which is at odds with linguistic evidence and Baluch lore itself argues for an origin with the Arab Conquests #P ([Concept('dranganian_source_2','2')|I])#!. What little information we have indicates that an East Iranian people called the Drangianans lived in the Helmand watershed during the Achaemnid times, and subsequent settlement and migration brought Saka, Parthian, and Persian peoples to the region.\n\nOn the other hand, the mountainous southern lands were significant independent and isolated, which contributed to poor record keeping. The fact that Baloch is a Northwest Iranian language would hint a Parthian contribution (supported further by the occupation of the region by the Indo-Parthian kingdom in the Ist through IIIrd Centuries AD), but the sparsity of the region and its general inhospitability have made archeological and historic analysis of the region very difficult.\n\nFor the purposes of game mechanics, $wtwsms_italic$ elects to make the pre-Baloch peoples of inland Balochistan a hybrid of Brahui and Parthian, the former as we take the view that the Brahui represent a relic population in the region and the later as Baloch is a Northwest Iranian language, of which Parthian is the most likely progenitor $controversy_short_note$.

 game_concept_malavas_culture_desc: "The Malavas were an ancient Indian tribe originally from Punjab that, between the IVth Century BC and the Ist Century AD, settled in what is today Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. They are probably descended from the #italic Malloi#! who fought against Alexander in his Mallian campaign #P ([Concept('malavas_source','1')|I])#!.\n\nThe Malavas are the predecessors of the people in the region of modern Malwa and Rajasthan."
 game_concept_sinhala_proto_culture: "Pre-Anuradhapura Sri Lanka"
 game_concept_sinhala_proto_culture_desc: "The history of Sri Lanka prior to the Anuradhapura kingdom is poorly documented and mostly shrouded in folklore and epics. From the legend of Prince Vijaya, and studies of Elu Prakrit, a tentative link between the Sinhalese and proto-Bengalis can be made.\n\nThe legend of Prince Vijaya appears to have at least some basis in fact when reviewing genetic studies of Sri Lankans; studies indicate a link between some Bengali populations and the Sinhalese #P ([Concept('sinhalese_genetics_1','1')|I])#!.

 #Levantine cultures
 game_concept_babylonian_culture: "Assyro-Babylonian Culture"
 game_concept_babylonian_culture_desc: "The demographics of Asoristan during the Late Antique and Early Middle Ages is difficult to parse. Because of the large-scale population transfers of the Assyrian Empire and later demographic pressure, the old Akkadian speakers of Southern Mesopotamia eventually adopted Aramaic as a common tongue by the Ist Century AD. Southern Mesopotamia remained especially diverse, both religiously and culturally, with large numbers of Manicheans, Pagans, and Mandeans among the mostly Christian population and a combination of Persian aristocrats, Nabatean traders, and Arab nomands.\n\nWhile large numbers of pagans also existed in the north, the diversity of north Asoristan was not as great as the south. Additionally, the northern part of Asoristan was the historic heartland of the Assyrian peoples, who have had a cultural continuity from the ancient Assyrian Empire to the modern day. \n\nBecause of the difference in both terrain and culture, we divide the Aramaic-speaking population of Asoristan into two cultures:  an Assyrian population in the North and a \"Chaldean\" population in the south. Functionally, the two groups were somewhat hard to separate, and as such, cultures with Aramean or Assyrian Traditions have a higher [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline than they would otherwise have.\n\nThe use of the term \"Chaldean\" for the Armaic speakers of Southern Mesopotamia is dated and #italic somewhat#! inaccurate, but we use it for lack of a better term $controversy_short_note$."

 game_concept_ninrun_culture: "The Ninrun"
 game_concept_ninrun_culture_desc: "The origin of the Rouran remains a minor issue of contention. Primary Chinese sources argue a primarily Xiongnu origin, but there is a tendency of Chinese annals to ascribe all northern \"barbarians\" to the Xiongnu. Others argue a link to the Dong-Hu, Xianbei, the Khitans, or the Kumo Xi. Genetic studies seem to indicate a strong patrilenal Dong-Hu component, which is associated with the Xianbei at the time #P ([Concept('rouran_genetics','1')|I])#!.

 #Turkic Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_xiongnu_culture: "Xiongnu Ethnogenesis"
 game_concept_xiongnu_culture_desc: "The ethnic identity of the Xiongnu remains a controversial question involving research in the fields of archaeology, genetics, and linguistics. The least controversial aspect is the genetic analysis; based on autosomal ancestry, the Xiongnu are a heterogeneous group combining influences of the East Asian Slab Grave Culture (ca. 1300-300 BC) and West Eurasian influences, most likely containing elements of the Sakan Pazyryk and Sagly/Uyuk Cultures #P ([Concept('xiongnu_genetic_source','1')|I])#!. Somewhat confounding these findings is the Xiongnu's historic marriage alliances with the Han Chinese, which introduces a high amount of Han Chinese genetic influence in the ruling stratum that was unlikely to have effected the genetic disposition of the common people.\n\nThis, of course does not answer the cultural identification of the Xiongnu themselves, as genetics is not synonymous with culture. Linguistically, several incompatible theories have support among historians, including Turkic, Iranian, Yeniseian, Mongolic, and even a linguistic isolate have varying levels of support. The name Xiongnu itself is a pejorative in Chinese, meaning \"fierce slave\" #P ([Concept('xiongnu_name_note','a')|I])#!, although it is possible that this may be a transliteration of #italic Huna#! or a reference to the Ongi River.\n\nIn reality, the Xiongnu were probably a heterogeneous group within which were probably strong Proto-Turkic and Proto-Mongolic elements. Ultimately, the limitations of game mechanics forces us to make compromises, and given the genetic and (somewhat controversial) cultural links between the Xiongnu and and the Huns, we have chosen to make the Xiongnu a Turkic culture #P ([Concept('xiongnu_genetic_source','1')|I],[Concept('yorulmazoglu_turkic_history','3')|I])#!.

 game_concept_hunas_culture_desc: "Huna is an Indian name to a group of Central Asian tribes who entered the Indian subcontinent in the Vth and VIth Centuries AD. The precise origins of these people is a matter of debate, although it appears that the Hepthalites, Xionites, Kidarites, and others were a set of related people.\n\nBoth textual (e.g., the colour white being tied to the southern direction) would indicate a Turkic influence #P ([Concept('yorulmazoglu_turkic_history','1')|I])#!, while the extensive use of Bactrian in official correspondence would indicate Iranian influence or fusion with local elements, possibly being adopted as a native language after a period of settlement.\n\nMost likely, like the Xiongnu, the various Huna peoples were a heterogeneous group that included a number of elements. For those Ancient Indian sources identify as Huna, they were likely part of a period of migration in the IVth Century AD in response to climatic changes in Northern Eurasia.\n\n#bold For the purposes of game mechanics, we make the Hunas culture a Xiognu/Bactrian Hybrid.#!"
 #Serindian Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_paleo_khotanese_culture: "Pre-Saka Khotan"
 game_concept_paleo_khotanese_culture_desc: "The pre-Saka period of Khotan is not well documented. Although Xuanzang documents several founding legends tying Khotan to the city of Taxila in Punjab, some historians consider this to be more of an attempted explanation for the Chinese and Indian influences in Khotan in the VIIth Century AD.\n\nOther evidence may indicate that the city was founded by Greco-Bactrian settlers, given Hellenistic influences found on the Sampul tapestry. \n\nAnother possibility, as the region lies on the crossroads of several competing cultural spheres of influence, the Khotan kingdom was a multiethnic confederation from which Tocharian, Sakan, Chinese, and Indian influences combined.\n\n#bold For the purposes of game mechanics, we treat Khotanese as a Saka-Tocharian hybrid.#!"
 #Germanic Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_elbe_germanic_culture: "Elbe Germanic Peoples"
 game_concept_elbe_germanic_culture_desc: "Elbe Germanic, or Irimonic, is a term used to describe an unattested proto-language that evolved into the later Lombardic, Alemannic, Bavarian, and Thuringian dialects of German.\n\nThe full extent of the Irimonic-speaking peoples at the beginning of the Late Antiquity Period extended as far as the Oder River and Danube, and such groups intermixed with other Germanic peoples within Germania Magna."
 game_concept_west_germanic_culture: "Istvaeonic Germanic Peoples"
 game_concept_west_germanic_culture_desc: "The Istvaeones were a Germanic group of tribes occupying the Weser-Rhine region of Europe in Late Antiquity. Among these groups are the Batavi, Chamavi, Chatti, and (tenuously) the Frisii.\n\n It is likely that the Franks developed from this group, as various attestations in the IVth and Vth Centuries AD link the Franks to a number of Istvaeonic tribes. By the late Vth Century AD, the Franks had become pre-eminent in the Rhine basin, and (besides some potential attestation to the Chatti in the Vth Century AD), had replaced most of the former Istvaeones."
 game_concept_suebian_culture: "Suebian Culture"
 game_concept_suebian_culture_desc: "The Suebians, or Suebi/Suevi/Suavi, were a large group of Germanic peoples mentioned in Classical and Late Antiquity, associated with various [elbe_germanic_culture|E] groups such as the Marcomanni, Quadi, Hermunduri, Semnones, and Lombards. The precise definition of the group was fluid and changed throughout history, although Tacitus and Pliny mention them as a major subdivision of the Germans.\n\nThe Suebi would play a major role in Roman history, including the Marcomannic Wars during the Crisis of the Third Century.\n\nA group of Suebians under Hermeric would cross the Danube with the Alans and Vandals, overrunning Gaul and Hispania and establishing the Kingdom of the Suebi in Gallacia.\n\nOther groups under Hunimund would fall under Hunnic dominion and later become part of the Alemannic confederation according to Jordanes."

 game_concept_general_wtwsms_controversy_note_desc: "Like many aspects of this period, we acknowledge such mappings as somewhat controversial, but, given the limited information available, we believe this is a defensible proposition."
 game_concept_xiongnu_name_note: "The Xiongu Autonym Question"
 game_concept_xiongnu_name_note_desc: "As we do not have an accurate rendering of the Xiongnu's autonym, we use the name Xiongnu within the game"
 game_concept_lusitani_note: "Lusitani Note"
 game_concept_lusitani_note_desc: "While $wtwsms_italic$ has Lusitani in the 476 scenario, these represent the Celticized and Romanized Lusitani, whose original culture and identity has been subsumed after centuries of contact and domination."
 game_concept_tiele_note: "Tiele Note"
 game_concept_tiele_note_desc: "We use the Chinese name for this confederation as the precise Turkish word it translates is a matter of debate, and prefer to use Türk for the cultures that come from the Göktürk Khaganate."
 game_concept_romano_african_note: "Romano-African Note"
 game_concept_romano_african_note_desc: "Carthago formed the centre of Romano-African culture and Carthaginian lands were among the first territories seized by Rome in its conquest of Africa, which leads us to identify the Punics as the parent culture. Additionally, the Punic influence remained strongest in the cities, which the later Roman identity followed as well."
 #Years

 game_concept_suebi_split_year_desc: "In AD 409, an element of the Suebi under Hermeric crossed the Rhine, as part of a group with the Vandals and Alans. These Suebi settled in Galicia, establishing the Kingdom of the Suebi, centred on Bracara Augusta (modern Braga).\n\n#bold Because technology is closely tied to culture in CK3, we have had to split the Suebi in Galicia into a different culture from the remaining Suebi north of the Danube.#!\n\nThis choice was done to reflect the game mechanics, not necessarily endorsing the idea that the Suebi in Galicia were culturally different from their tribal brethren."

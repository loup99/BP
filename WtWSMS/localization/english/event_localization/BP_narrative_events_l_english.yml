 #Fall of Rome
 bp_narrative_events.0001.name:0 "Rome has Fallen!"
 bp_narrative_events.0001.desc:0 "The city of Rome has finally fallen to the onslaught of the [barbarian_ruler.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] invaders, the ancient city reduced to rubble. While this might not be the end of the Roman state, it will be nearly impossible to preserve its true integrity without the spiritual center of the world. Today marks the end of one thousand years of Roman domination across the known world."

 #Julius Nepos reconquers Italy
 bp_narrative_events.0003.name:0 "Victory of Nepos"
 bp_narrative_events.0003.desc.a:0 "After having been forced to flee to Dalmatia due to the machinations of the Patrician Orestes who placed his son Romulus Augustulus upon the throne of the Western Roman Empire as his puppet, your victory and return to Italy marks a return to power after a long period in exile. This reconquest is also a change in the turn of events following the fall of Rome, and may indicate that a restitution of the old order and authority of the West is underway. Old holders and claimants of what is rightfully yours have been imprisoned and stripped of their holdings. On the other hand, while you are technically recognised as the legitimate emperor in the West by the Eastern Roman Empire, ambitious vassals and other claimants may exploit your relative weakness in their favour and try to grab the imperial title for themselves. The period of turmoil may not have ended..."

 bp_narrative_events.0004.desc:0 "The City of Rome has fallen to the barbarian hordes, we in the east must find some way to supplant those barbaric invaders from their unjust throne. Perhaps we should contact our old Foedarati the Ostrogoths and see if they are willing to help us?"

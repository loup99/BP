 #Subroman Taxation Decay Event
 BP_subroman_events.0010.title_3:0 "Roman Taxation"
 BP_subroman_events.0010.title_2:0 "Remains of Roman Taxation"
 BP_subroman_events.0010.title_1:0 "Vestiges of Roman Taxation"
 BP_subroman_events.0010.desc_a_32:0 "With time,"
 BP_subroman_events.0010.desc_a_1:0 "With time, the last vestiges of the old infrastructures"
 BP_subroman_events.0010.desc_b:0 " the old infrastructures that allowed for taxes of the Roman Empire to be collected have decayed. The Roman system was built upon censuses and tax collectors, which we have not maintained for a long time, meaning records are outdated and no longer correspond to reality. Now we face the choice of either attempting to maintain the Roman taxation of old, which while more profitable on the long-term could anger the population, come at a steep cost and only delay what might be inevitable, or accept the decline of the taxation infrastructure and permanently accept abandoning that source of revenue but not limit liberties."
 BP_subroman_events.0010.maintain:0 "We must maintain the Roman taxation infrastructure."
 BP_subroman_events.0010.decay:0 "We will not maintain this relic of long-gone times."
 #Vassal asks for taxes to be reduced
 BP_subroman_events.0011.title:0 "Roman Taxation"
 BP_subroman_events.0011.desc:0 "With time, the old infrastructures that allowed for taxes of the Roman Empire to be collected have decayed. The Roman system was built upon censuses and tax collectors, which have not been maintained for a long time, meaning records are outdated and no longer correspond to reality. As a vassal within a realm marked by this history, this could be the occasion for us to demand to our liege to abandon this fiscal system, which would lower the amount of taxes we pay and affirm our liberties as a vassal, although a such demand could anger our liege."
 BP_subroman_events.0011.ask_for_reduction:0 "We shall ask our liege to abandon this taxation."
 BP_subroman_events.0011.let_it_be:0 "We will not make any such demands, we should let it be."
 #Liege recieves a request to lower taxes
 BP_subroman_events.0012.opening:0 "[the_sender.Custom2('AppropriateGreeting',ROOT.Char)]"
 BP_subroman_events.0012.desc:0 "The taxation system we inherited from the Roman Empire is long out of date and we would do well to abandon it in favour of a more accurate system that guarantees our liberties. Do you agree?"
 BP_subroman_events.0012.accept:0 "This is a fair demand, we will accept to abandon it."
 BP_subroman_events.0012.refuse:0 "How dare [the_sender.GetSheHe] present a such request, we will refuse!"
 #Liege accepts the request to lower taxes
 BP_subroman_events.0013.opening:0 "[the_liege.Custom2('AppropriateGreeting',ROOT.Char)]"
 BP_subroman_events.0013.desc:0 "This is a fair demand, we accept your proposition to abandon it."
 #Liege refuses the request to lower taxes

 BP_subroman_events.0014.desc:0 "How dare you present a such request, we refuse!"
 #Crisis Event
 BP_subroman_events.0020.title:0 "An Ongoing Crisis"
 BP_subroman_events.0020.desc:0 "The repeated warfare and looting that is currently ongoing within our realm has lead to one or more provinces being severely harmed and war torn, which has caused a period of instability, confusion and crisis in the area. This crisis has significantly impoverished the local population and weakened our control, introducing disturbance and damaging the continuity of institutions inherited from Roman times."
 BP_subroman_events.0020.a:0 "What a disaster!"
 #Landed Armies
 BP_subroman_events.0030.title:0 "Military Evolution"
 BP_subroman_events.0030.desc:0 "As our army gets more landed with time, and is no longer a tax-funded standing one, we have ended up investing less money the military, which in itself diminishes the need for collecting as many taxes as during Roman times, when the army was funded through tax collecting. The fiscal system being less needed, the question for the need of maintaining it or not as in the past poses itself."
 BP_subroman_events.0030.a:0 "Landed armies represent the future."
 #Military Culture Changes
 BP_subroman_events.0040.title:0 "Changing Aristocratic Values"
 BP_subroman_events.0040.desc:0 "With changing polities and institutions, a new aristocracy has progressively emerged with different cultural values than the Roman ones. Due to the degree of crisis and warfare that has shaped our realm after the dominance of the Roman Empire, the social status of the army has increased, and it is now viewed as prestigious to pursue a military career and educate noble children to the art of war while neglecting other domains, where it might have been frowned upon in the past."
 BP_subroman_events.0040.a:0 "This will benefit my armies."
 #Clergy Culture Changes
 BP_subroman_events.0050.title:0 "Changing Aristocratic Values"
 BP_subroman_events.0050.desc:0 "The instability and crisis induced by war these latest decades has lead to an increasing part of the aristocracy turning itself and its children towards the Church and ecclesiastic careers. Due to its wealth and influence, as well as the benefit of patronage and praying, the nobility now views the clergy status differently than in late Roman times."
 BP_subroman_events.0050.a:0 "In the service of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 #Transition to Feudalism
 BP_subroman_events.0060.title:0 "The Feudal Mutation"
 BP_subroman_events.0060.desc:0 "Despite the days of Roman dominance over our lands being long gone and the varying degrees of crisis that ensued, for centuries we kept elements of Roman government and signs of continuity in our realms, whether it was in the fiscal system, the nature of the army or the cultural values of the nobility. Yet now, with these changes in government, a new form of governance, based more upon the mutual relationships and confidence between the nobles holding lands as personal demesne, vassals and their lieges, has begun to emerge."
 BP_subroman_events.0060.a:0 "A new era begins."

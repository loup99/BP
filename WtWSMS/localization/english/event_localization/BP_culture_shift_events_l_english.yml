 bp_heritage_linguistic_drift.0002.desc.latin: "Where once all peoples of the Western Mediterranean spoke a single Latin Language with regional dialects, the fracturing of the Western Empire into dozens, hundreds of states and statelets have effectively halted trade and exchange, sharpening regional differences.\n\nNow the tongue of the [shift_culture.GetName] people has changed enough from Latin that it is no longer intelligible with Latin."
 bp_heritage_linguistic_drift.0002.desc: "As time goes on and polities change and people move, languages begin to change. Regional variations build up, until the spoken language can no longer be called the same. This has occurred in the [shift_culture.GetName] culture, whose tongue has now deviated significantly from its old form."

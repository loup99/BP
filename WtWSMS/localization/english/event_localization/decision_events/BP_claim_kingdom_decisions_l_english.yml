 BP_claim_kingdom_decisions.0001.desc: "Since Vache II was forced to abdicate, the throne of [Glossary('#italic Aghwank#!','AGHWANK_GLOSS')] has been left empty. With enough glory and sufficient political clout, [the_albanian_reformer.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to convince the Persian Shahanshah to recognize his claim to the throne. #italic Aghwank#! is no longer kingless!"

 AGHWANK_GLOSS: "Caucasian Albania is known by many names; to the Albanians it was #italic Aghuank'#!, to the Parthians it was #italic Ardhan#!, to the Persians #italic Arran#!, to the Arabs #italic ar-Ran#!, to the Georgians #italic Rani#!, and to the Greeks #italic Albania#!. The name the native inhabitants gave their polity is unknown, although the inhabitants spoke a Lezgic language that was the progenitor of the modern Udi langauge. For simplicity, we use the name Aghwank, one of several transliterations for the polity."

With this union under a mighty ruler, the Franks pose a formidable military threat to their direct neighbors, and their aim seems to be to continue on the path of conquest."

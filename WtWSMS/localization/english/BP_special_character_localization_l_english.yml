His unpopularity was his ultimate undoing, as when Zeno returned to Constantinople, the Senate opened the gates for the barbarian Emperor.\n\nCaptured in the #italic Magna Ecclesia#!, Basiliscus surrendered to Zeno under the agreement the barbarian not shed his or his family's blood. Thus, they were enclosed in a cistern in Cappadocia, where they died from exposure.\n\n$basiliscus_bookmark_special_war_warning$"

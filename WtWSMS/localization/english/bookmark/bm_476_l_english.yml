 bm_476_wre: "Denouement of an Empire"
 bm_476_wre_desc: "By the 460s, the Western Roman Empire had entered its terminal phase; by 476 Ravenna only controlled Italy proper and little else besides. Romulus \"Augustulus\" (meaning \"little Augustus\") sits on the throne, a mere pupput for his Father Orestes, while the other lands of the Western Part of the Empire remain under the control of Roman Rump states or Barbarian Kingdoms.\n\nDalmatia and Soissons remain the only two states of note under the control of Romans, while the Eastern Empire looks on, consumed by its own problems.\n\nWill the young Romulus, guided by his ambitious father Orestes, somehow manage to salvage the situation? Will Nepos be able to leave Dalmatia and rise once more to be hailed as Augustus? Can Syagrius manage to convert his polity into something more permanent?\n\nOr is this the last gasps of the Western Roman Empire?"

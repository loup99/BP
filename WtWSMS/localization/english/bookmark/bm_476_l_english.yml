Meanwhile, Theodoric of the Ostrogoths looks at the peninsula, weighing his options. Will Rome fall to Odovacar? To Theodoric? Will the young Romulus Augustulus maintain his power against all odds, in the twilight of the Empire? Or will Julius Nepos, a shadow of his former self, rise once more to be hailed as Augustus?\n\nThe Eastern half of the Empire watches the destiny of the West carefully while dealing with its own upheaval."

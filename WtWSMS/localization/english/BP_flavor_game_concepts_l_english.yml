 #Romanized Groups
 game_concept_rhaetian_culture: "Rhaetian Culture"
 game_concept_rhaetian_culture_desc: "The Rhaeti were a confederation of Alpine tribes related to the Etruscans, whose name lent itself to the Roman province of Raetia. The Rhaeti language itself may have been spoken as late as the IIIrd Century AD, but by the Ist Century BC, the process of language death was already well underway.\n\nBy the Vth Century AD, Romanization was complete, and the last of the Tyrsenian languages was dead."

 game_concept_noric_culture_desc: "The area that would become the Roman province of Noricum was inhabited by Celtic peoples prior to the Roman conquest. The region became famous for the quality of its iron. The Norics were related to the Taurisci in modern Carinthia and northern Slovenia, according to Pliny the Elder; this statement has not been generally accepted by modern historians."

 game_concept_paleo_sardinian_culture_desc: "The pre-Roman peoples of Sardinian, also known as Nuragic Culture, named after the Nuraghe structures they left behind. The culture existed on Sardinia from at least the XVIIIth Century BC until the Roman Conquest in 238 BC (and possibly until the VIth Century AD in the Barbagia region of Sardinia). While the culture left few written records, extensive material evidence remains of the later Nuragic tribes, the Balares and the Iliensis, as well as records left by surrounding civilizations.\n\nFollowing the Roman Conquest, the islands had considerable settlement from Italy and extensive Romanization, although some tribes, such as the Parati, Sossinati, Balari, and Aconites remained outside Roman control into Imperial times #P ([Concept('strabo_source','1')|I])#! and resisted Christianization until the late VIth Century AD, when Pope Gregory I sent a mission to convert Hospito's tribe in Barbagia."

 #Greek Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_phocaea_culture: "Ionian Culture"
 game_concept_phocaea_culture_desc: "The Ionians were one of the four major subdivisions of Greeks in the ancient period; others included Dorians, Aeolians, and Achaeans. Because of their small numbers and the extended period that the Massalians have had under Roman domination, the Massalians speak Latin like the surrounding groups by the Vth Century AD."
 #Iranian Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_indo_parthian_proto_culture: "History of Baluchistan"
 game_concept_indo_parthian_proto_culture_desc: "The history of Baluchistan prior to the Arab conquest is poorly documented, in part on account of limited archaeological work in the region. The modern Baluch people are not clearly referenced in history until the VIIIth Century AD #P ([Concept('indo_parthian_source_1','1')|I])#!, and Baluch lore itself argues for an origin with the Arab Conquests #P ([Concept('indo_parthian_source_2','2')|I])#!, so the notion of a Baluch identity is unlikely in Late Antiquity.\n\nGiven the Baluch speak a Northwestern Iranian language, migration of Iranian elements (such as Parthians) seems likely. Indeed, a true identity for the Iranian people of the region might only have arisen during the Caliphate.\n\nGiven the paucity of the information, we assign the culture of Baluchistan for Late Antiquity as Indo-Parthian; the Baluchistan region had been part of the Indian cultural sphere since the Indus Valley Civilization, and the region remained at the cross-roads of both Indian and Iranian influences, for which the Pāratarājas and Paratan was the latest expression prior to beginning of $wtwsms_italic$.\n\n#bold For the purposes of game mechanics, we model Indo-Parthian as a Parthian/Sindhi hybrid#!."

 game_concept_paleo_azeri_culture: "Paleo-Atropatene Cultures"
 game_concept_paleo_azeri_culture_desc: "The region known as Media Atropatene (or Iranian Azerbaijan in modern parlance) is a historical region in modern Northwest Iran. Historically, the region contained a number of different peoples prior to the conquest by the Medes in 609 BC. These include:\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The Matiene, a kingdom whose population possibly spoke a Hurro-Uratian language. Because of the Scythian and Cimmerian migrations, influences from Eastern Iranian speaking peoples cannot be ruled out.\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$Caspians, a possibly pre-Indo-European people who lived south of the Araxes River.\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$Cyrtians, a nomadic group of potentially Iranian or non-Iranian ancestry (or both), who lived in the Zagros Mountains.\n\nAfter the conquest of Media by the Achaemenid Empire, the region, the region underwent extensive Iranianization.

 game_concept_paleo_cyrtian_culture: "Paleo-Zagros Cultures"
 game_concept_paleo_cyrtian_culture_desc: "A number of non-Iranian nomadic groups lived in the Zagros Mountains during Antiquity, including the Uxii, Cyrtians, Lullubi, and Gutians. By the Vth Century AD, these groups had been under the process of Iranianization for several centuries and this process was either complete or nearing completion.\n\nBecause of the restrictions of game mechanics and the general lack of firm data, we group all these people together as Crytians and made them an Iranian speaking, Iranian heritage culture."
 #Indo-Aryan Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_malavas_culture: "Malavas People"
 game_concept_malavas_culture_desc: "The Malavas were an ancient Indian tribe originally from Punjab that, between the IVth Century BC and the Ist Century AD, settled in what is today Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. They are probably descended from the #italic Malloi#! who fought against Alexander in his Mallian campaign #P ([Concept('malavas_source','1')|I])#!.\n\nThe Malavas are the predecessors of the people in the region of modern Malwa and Rajasthan."
 game_concept_sinhala_proto_culture: "Pre-Anuradhapura Sri Lanka"
 game_concept_sinhala_proto_culture_desc: "The history of Sri Lanka prior to the Anuradhapura kingdom is poorly documented and mostly shrouded in folklore and epics. From the legend of Prince Vijaya, and studies of Elu Prakrit, a tentative link between the Sinhalese and proto-Bengalis can be made.\n\nThe legend of Prince Vijaya appears to have at least some basis in fact when reviewing genetic studies of Sri Lankans; studies indicate a link between some Bengali populations and the Sinhalese #P ([Concept('sinhalese_genetics_1','1')|I])#!. These studies also reveal links with the Tamils #P ([Concept('sinhalese_genetics_1','1')|I],[Concept('sinhalese_genetics_2','2')|I])#! and (likely) indigenous Vedda people, although much more of the former than the later #P ([Concept('sinhalese_genetics_2','2')|I])#!.\n\nFrom these studies we can conclude that the Sinhalese population is a complex admixture of Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, and indigenous populations, possibly involving an elite transfer from Bengal.\n\n#bold For the purposes of game mechanics, we model the Sinhalese as a Bengali/Tamil hybrid#! $controversy_short_note$"
 #Mongolic Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_donghu_culture: "The Dong-Hu"
 game_concept_donghu_culture_desc: "The Dong-Hu is a Chinese name meaning \"Eastern Barbarians\" and in particular refers to the nomadic people in what is today northern Heibei, southeastern Inner Mongolia, and western Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang in the last centuries BC; the terms is contrasted with Xi-hu meaning \"Western Barbarians\".\n\nThe Donghu were eventually conquered by the Xiongnu under Modu Chanyu (ca. 200-175 BC), and afterwards split into the Wuhuan and Xianbei; the later would become a contributing group that formed the Khitan while the former would play a role in the downfall of the Xiongnu confederacy.\n\n#bold Considering the Chinese links of the Donghu with the later Khitans, in $wtwsms_italic$, we make the Donghu-derived cultures Mongolic heritage and speak various Para-Mongolic languages $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_ninrun_culture: "The Ninrun"
 game_concept_ninrun_culture_desc: "The origin of the Rouran remains a minor issue of contention. Primary Chinese sources argue a primarily Xiongnu origin, but there is a tendency of Chinese annals to ascribe all northern \"barbarians\" to the Xiongnu. Others argue a link to the Dong-Hu, Xianbei, the Khitans, or the Kumo Xi. Genetic studies seem to indicate a strong patrilenal Dong-Hu component, which is associated with the Xianbei at the time #P ([Concept('rouran_genetics','1')|I])#!. Compounding the issue is the relative fluidity of cultural identification on the steppe and the regular flow of genetics across the region.\n\n#bold For the purposes of game mechanics, we model the Rouran culture as a Xiongnu/Xianbei hybrid#! $controversy_short_note$. Because of the tensions between the Rouran and the later Turkic Khaganate, we model the Rouran as a Mongolic heritage culture. Based on recent linguistic analysis, we make the Rouran language a Para-Mongolic language, related to, but distinct from, the Proto-Mongolic of the pre-Mongolic Shiwei peoples #P ([Concept('rouran_linguistics','2')|I])#!."
 #Turkic Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_xiongnu_culture: "Xiongnu Ethnogenesis"
 game_concept_xiongnu_culture_desc: "The ethnic identity of the Xiongnu remains a controversial question involving research in the fields of archaeology, genetics, and linguistics. The least controversial aspect is the genetic analysis; based on autosomal ancestry, the Xiongnu are a heterogeneous group combining influences of the East Asian Slab Grave Culture (ca. 1300-300 BC) and West Eurasian influences, most likely containing elements of the Sakan Pazyryk and Sagly/Uyuk Cultures #P ([Concept('xiongnu_genetic_source','1')|I])#!. Somewhat confounding these findings is the Xiongnu's historic marriage alliances with the Han Chinese, which introduces a high amount of Han Chinese genetic influence in the ruling stratum that was unlikely to have effected the genetic disposition of the common people.\n\nThis, of course does not answer the cultural identification of the Xiongnu themselves, as genetics is not synonymous with culture. Linguistically, several incompatible theories have support among historians, including Turkic, Iranian, Yeniseian, Mongolic, and even a linguistic isolate have varying levels of support. The name Xiongnu itself is a pejorative in Chinese, meaning \"fierce slave\" #P ([Concept('xiongnu_name_note','a')|I])#!, although it is possible that this may be a transliteration of #italic Huna#! or a reference to the Ongi River.\n\nIn reality, the Xiongnu were probably a heterogeneous group within which were probably strong Proto-Turkic and Proto-Mongolic elements. Ultimately, the limitations of game mechanics forces us to make compromises, and given the genetic and (somewhat controversial) cultural links between the Xiongnu and and the Huns, we have chosen to make the Xiongnu a Turkic culture #P ([Concept('xiongnu_genetic_source','1')|I],[Concept('yorulmazoglu_turkic_history','3')|I])#!. By the Vth Century AD, the Xiongnu confederation was no more and the remaining Xiongnu were likely Turkicized (given the remaining Xiongnu people's proximity to major Turkic confederations), so we assign them the Shaz Turkic language."
 game_concept_kurykan_culture: "Siberian Turkic Ethnogeneis"
 game_concept_kurykan_culture_desc: "The origin of the Northern Siberian Turks (in particular, the Yakuts), is somewhat difficult to fully unravel.\n\nBased on genetic analysis, the Yakuts themselves are an admixture of Turco-Mongols and native Siberian peoples in the Lena River basin.\n\nComputational Linguistic analysis of Turkic languages reveals that Northern Siberian Turkish was the earliest to split from Common Turkic, approximately 15-16 centuries before present #P ([Concept('siberian_turkic_linguistic_analysis','1')|I])#!.

 game_concept_tiele_culture: "Turks before the First Turkish Khaganate"
 game_concept_tiele_culture_desc: "The history of the Turkic peoples prior to the rise of the Göktürk Khaganate is poorly documented. While Chinese sources note the existence of some specific subgroups, such as the Yenisei Kyrgyz (transliterated as Gekun/Ko-Kun/Jiankun/Chien-kun), the main body of what would become the various Common Turkic-speaking Turkish cultures were still in the Altai-Sayan environs in the late Vth Century AD as part of the Tiele (or Chiele) Confederation #P ([Concept('tiele_note','a')|I])#!. This confederation was fairly long-lived, lasting from the IVth to the VIIIth Century AD, if the Chinese words Chile and Tiele indeed map to the same Turkish word. Most references to later Turkic cultures are centuries later. \n\nAs such, $wtwsms_italic$ utilizes Tiele as the representative culture for the Pre-Turkic Khaganate Common Turkic-speaking people (excepting the Kyrgyz and Kurykans). We further extend this cultural designation to the Yueban (or "Weak Xiongnu"), as the Yueban splinter tribes played a major role as part of the First Turkic Khaganate $controversy_short_note$."

 game_concept_hunnic_culture_desc: "The origin and ethnic identification of the European Huns is a matter of continuing debate among scholars, ever since Joseph de Guingnes proposed a link between the Xiongnu and the Huns.\n\nA number of arguments support a connection between the Northern Xiongnu and the various Hunnic peoples, including genetics and textual analysis; however, the general dearth of hard data makes it difficult to determine the ethnic identity of the Huns and Huna peoples.

To account for the genetic evidence, the Hunnic ethnicity map accounts for a combination of Xiongnu, Scytho-Sarmatian, and Gothic elements.

 game_concept_hunas_culture: "Origin of the Huna people"
 game_concept_hunas_culture_desc: "Huna is an Indian name to a group of Central Asian tribes who entered the Indian subcontinent in the Vth and VIth Centuries AD. The precise origins of these people is a matter of debate, although it appears that the Hepthalites, Xionites, Kidarites, and others were a set of related people.\n\nBoth textual (e.g., the colour white being tied to the southern direction) would indicate a Turkic influence #P ([Concept('yorulmazoglu_turkic_history','1')|I])#!, while the extensive use of Bactrian in official correspondence would indicate Iranian influence or fusion with local elements, possibly being adopted as a native language after a period of settlement.\n\nMost likely, like the Xiongnu, the various Huna peoples were a heterogeneous group that included a number of elements.

 game_concept_suebi_split_year: "Suavi/Suebi Split"
 game_concept_suebi_split_year_desc: "In AD 409, an element of the Suebi under Hermeric crossed the Rhine, as part of a group with the Vandals and Alans. These Suebi settled in Galicia, establishing the Kingdom of the Suebi, centred on Bracara Augusta (modern Braga).\n\n#bold Because technology is closely tied to culture in CK3, we have had to split the Suebi in Galicia into a different culture from the remaining Suebi north of the Danube.#!\n\nThis choice was done to reflect the game mechanics, not necessarily endorsing the idea that the Suebi in Galicia were culturally different from their tribal brethren."
 game_concept_visigothic_split_year: "Visigoth/Goth Split"
 game_concept_visigothic_split_year_desc: "The Goths, by the time they had extensive contacts with the Romans in the IIIrd and IVth Centuries, consisted primarily of two groups:  the Thervingi in the plains north of the lower Danube and the Greuthungi in the Pontic Steppe; the names appear to have been linked to geographic locations.\n\nContingents of both groups would invade Rome during the Gothic War of 376. Under the rule of Alaric, a portion of the Thervingi would go one to sack Rome and establish the Visigothic Kingdom in Gaul.\n\n#bold In $wtwsms_italic$, we have chosen the date of Ataulf's settlement of Toulouse and Nabaronne as the formative date for the rise of the Visigoths as a separate culture#!."

What is clear is that Gothic components settled in Thrace and Pannonia following the arrival of the Huns.\n\nIt is under the reign of Valamir in Pannonia that the Ostrogoths coalesced as a separate identity.\n\n#bold In $wtwsms_italic$, we have chosen the date of the Battle of Nedao (which finally broke Hunnic domination) as the formative date for the rise of the Ostrogoths as a separate culture#!."

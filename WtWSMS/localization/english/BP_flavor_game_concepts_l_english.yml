 game_concept_archeological_complex_short: "Complex"
 game_concept_archeological_complex_desc: "\"In archaeology, a complex is a chronological subdivision of different artefact types such as stone tools, pottery, and the like. Complexes are often defined on the basis of the similarities of industries between different sites within a region dating from roughly the same time period (1).\"\n\nWithin #italic When the World Stopped Making Sense#!, there are a number of groups that played a pivotal role in the ethnogenesis of later groups, but for whom evidence is scant or precise relations are unknown.\n\nFor the sake of accuracy, we include references to these groups within tooltips.\n\n(1) - Definition taken from the UCSB Department of Archaeology Webpage"
 #Romanized Groups
 game_concept_rhaetian_culture: "Rhaetian Culture"
 game_concept_rhaetian_culture_short: "Rhaetian"
 game_concept_rhaetian_culture_desc: "The Rhaeti were a confederation of Alpine tribes related to the Etruscans, whose name lent itself to the Roman province of Raetia. The Rhaeti language itself may have been spoken as late as the IIIrd Century AD, but by the Ist Century BC, the process of language death was already well underway.\n\nBy the Vth Century AD, Romanization was complete, and the last of the Tyrsenian languages was dead."
 game_concept_noric_culture: "Noric Culture"
 game_concept_noric_culture_short: "Noric"
 game_concept_noric_culture_desc: "The area that would become the Roman province of Noricum was inhabited by Celtic peoples. The region became famous for the quality of its iron. The Norics were related to the Taurisci in modern Carinthia and northern Slovenia, according to Pliny the Elder; this statement has not been generally accepted by modern historians."
 game_concept_pannonian_culture: "Pannonian Culture"
 game_concept_pannonian_culture_short: "Pannonian"
 game_concept_pannonian_culture_desc: "The Ancient Pannonians are a subgroup of the Illyrian peoples, who occupied the region later known as the Roman province of Pannonia.\n\nExisting on the boundary between the Illyrian and Celtic peoples, some of the Pannonian tribes were Celticized.\n\nWhile part of the greater Illyrian peoples, the Pannonians were a distinct subgroup from those that formed the Romano-Illyrians, and as such the Romano-Pannonians are a separate group from the Romano-Illyrians."
 game_concept_paleo_sardinian_culture: "Nuragic Culture"
 game_concept_paleo_sardinian_culture_short: "Nuragic"
 game_concept_paleo_sardinian_culture_desc: "The pre-Roman peoples of Sardinian, also known as Nuragic Culture, named after the Nuraghe structures they left behind. The culture existed on Sardinia from at least the XVIIIth Century BC until the Roman Conquest in 238 BC (and possibly until the VIth Century AD in the Barbagia region of Sardinia). While the culture left few written records, extensive material evidence remains of the later Nuragic tribes, the Balares and the Iliensis, as well as records left by surrounding civilizations.\n\nFollowing the Roman Conquest, the islands had considerable settlement from Italy and extensive Romanization, although some tribes, such as the Parati, Sossinati, Balari, and Aconites remained outside Roman control into Imperial times (1) and resisted Christianization until the late VIth Century, when Pope Gregory I sent a mission to convert Hospito.\n\n(1) Strabo #italic Geographica#!

 game_concept_paleo_corsican_culture: "Corsi Culture"
 game_concept_paleo_corsican_culture_short: "Corsi"
 game_concept_paleo_corsican_culture_desc: "The Corsi are the pre-Roman people of Corisca (and northern Sardinia) who lived on the island prior to the Roman conquest. While ancient authors connect the to either the Ligurians or Etruscans, their actual identification remains a mystery.\n\nThey were possibly related to the Bronze Age Torrean Civilization in Southern Corsica, but the limited evidence prevents any substantial conclustion."
 game_concept_paleo_iberian_culture: "Paleo-Iberian Cultures"
 game_concept_paleo_iberian_culture_short: "Paleo-Iberians"
 game_concept_paleo_iberian_culture_desc: "Prior to the Roman Conquest, Iberia contained a number of different cultures that were later subsumed into the Romanized population of the Iberian Peninsula. Among them are:\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The #italic Hispani#! of coastal Hispania Citerior, Hispania Tarraconensis, and Hispania Ulterior, whose language is unclassified and was extinct by the IInd century. The #italic Hispani#! were noted horse breeders and warriors who displayed significant social stratification.\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The #italic Turdetani#! of Baetica, a people of uncertain relation; it is possible they were related to the #italic Hispani#!, or the pre-Celtic Indo-European peoples of the peninsula such as the Lusitani and Vettones, or the non-Indo-European Tartessians (whose kingdom survived in the region until at least the IVth Century BC. It is even possible they were not related to any other group in the peninsula.\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$A number of Celtic tribes, such as the Celtiberi and Celtici of Hispania Tarraconensis and Hispania Lustiania, who were thoroughly Romanized by the end of the Vth Century AD.\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The Pre-Celtic Indo-European Tribes such as the Lusitani (1) and the Vettones of Hispania Lustiania. They spoke Indo-European languages, potentially related to Celtic or Italic branches. Noted warriors, these groups resisted Romanization and maintained an independent identity until at least the Ist Century AD, and in the case of the Lusitani, probably until the Vth.\n\nThe Romano-Hispanic culture is a combination of these influences as well as Roman culture.\n\n(1) - While #italic When the World Stopped Making Sense#! has Lusitani in the 476 scenario, these represent the Celticized and Romanized Lusitani, whose original culture and identity has been subsumed after centuries of contact and domination."

 game_concept_paleo_roman_african_culture_short: "Northwest African Cultures"
 game_concept_paleo_roman_african_culture_desc: "Northwest Africa had a number of cultures that contributed to the formation of the Romano-African identity, although principally there were two main contributors:\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The Punic culture of the Carthaginian civilization, whose demise is chosen as the date for the creation of Romano-African culture.\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The Amazigh cultures, principally the Numidians and the Mauri.\n\nBecause of the limitations of game mechanics, Punic is chosen as the second parent culture for Roman-African, as Carthago formed the centre of Romano-African culture and Carthaginian lands were among the first territories seized by Rome in its conquest of Africa."
#Germanic Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_wielbark_culture: "Wielbark"
 game_concept_wielbark_culture_desc: "The Wielbark culture (or East Pomeranian-Mazovian culture) is an archaeological complex that flourished in the Vistula basin during the Ist to Vth Centuries AD.\n\nThis archaeological complex is associated with the Goths and other East Germanic peoples, although not exclusively so. By the IIIrd Century, expansion of the Wielbark culture had led to the ejection of the Przeworsk Culture from the Poznań region. By the IIIrd century, it reached as far south as the northern reaches of modern Ukraine, and may have played a role in the creation of the [cherniakhiv_culture|E] culture in Ukraine.\n\nBy the VIth Century, it began to be displaced by the Sukokw-Dziedzice Culture, associated with the early Slavs.\n\n For more information, consider reading Peter Heather's #italic Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe#!"
 game_concept_elbe_germanic_culture: "Irimonic"
 game_concept_elbe_germanic_culture_desc: "Elbe Germanic, or Irimonic, is a term used to describe an unattested proto-language that evolved into the later Lombardic, Alemannic, Bavarian, and Thuringian dialects of German.\n\nThe full extent of the Irimonic-speaking peoples at the beginning of the Late Antiquity Period extended as far as the Oder River and Danube, and such groups intermixed with other Germanic peoples within Germania Magna."
 game_concept_cherniakhiv_culture: "Cherniakhiv"
 game_concept_cherniakhiv_culture_desc: "The Cherniakhiv culture is a an [archeological_complex|E] that flourished between the IInd to the Vth Centuries AD in parts of modern Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, and Belarus.\n\nPotentially a multiethnic mix of Dacian, Sarmatian, and Gothic peoples, the Cherniakhiv culture is commonly associated with the Goths and related groups, as the earliest unambiguous attestations of the Goths link them to Scythia.\n\nThe decline of the Cherniakhiv culture is associated with the arrival of the Huns in the late IVth Century AD, which coincides with Ermanaric's invasion of Roman territory.\n\nThe Cherniakhiv culture was later supplanted by the Penkovka culture, associated with the Slavic Antes, in the aftermath of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire."
 game_concept_przeworsk_culture_history: "Przeworsk Culture"
 game_concept_przeworsk_culture_history_short: "Baltic, Celtic, Proto-Slavic, and Germanic Peoples"
 game_concept_przeworsk_culture_history_desc: "The Przeworsk culture is an [archeological_complex|E] that existed between the IIIrd Century BC and the Vth Century AD, in what is today the central Oder and Vistula Basins in modern Germany and Poland.\n\nThe most popular view of the Przeworsk culture is that it was a multiethnic material culture with Baltic, Celtic, and Germanic influences. The East Germanic Vandals and Lugii are linked to the culture, but were probably only a part of the Archaeological Complex.\n\nBy the late Vth century, the culture was in decline, corresponding with the arrival of the Huns and its subsequent effects on Eastern Europe. By the VIth century, the Slavic Prague-Korchak culture had replaced the Przeworsk culture.\n\nWithin #italic When the World Stopped Making Sense#!, the Przeworsk culture represents the remaining East Germanic component, given the Lugii and Vandals are both closely linked to the specific region Przeworsk occupies. The Baltic component is represented by the Vistula-Veneti."
 game_concept_west_germanic_culture: "Istvaeonic Germanic Peoples"
 game_concept_west_germanic_culture_short: "Istvaeonic-Speaking Peoples"
 game_concept_west_germanic_culture_desc: "The Istvaeones were a Germanic group of tribes occupying the Weser-Rhine region of Europe in Late Antiquity. Among these groups are the Batavi, Chamavi, Chatti, and (tenuously) the Frisii.\n\n It is likely that the Franks developed from this group, as various attestations in the IVth and Vth century AD link the Franks to a number of Istvaeonic tribes. By the late Vth century, the Franks had become pre-eminent in the Rhine basin, and (besides some potential attestation to the Chatti in the Vth Century), had replaced most of the former Istvaeones."
 game_concept_suebian_culture: "Suebian Culture"
 game_concept_suebian_culture_short: "Suebian Peoples"
 game_concept_suebian_culture_desc: "The Suebians, or Suebi/Suevi/Suavi, were a large group of Germanic peoples mentioned in Classical and Late Antiquity, associated with various [elbe_germanic_culture|E] groups such as the Marcomanni, Quadi, Hermunduri, Semnones, and Lombards. The precise definition of the group was fluid and changed throughout history, although Tacitus and Pliny mention them as a major subdivision of the Germans.\n\nThe Suebi would play a major role in Roman history, including the Marcomannic Wars during the Crisis of the Third Century.\n\nA group of Suebians under Hermeric would cross the Danube with the Alans and Vandals, overrunning Gaul and Hispania and establishing the Kingdom of the Suebi in Gallacia.\n\nOther groups under Hunimund would fall under Hunnic dominion and later become part of the Alemannic confederation according to Jordanes, likely contributing the later Baiuvarii in the VIth Century AD in modern Bavaria."

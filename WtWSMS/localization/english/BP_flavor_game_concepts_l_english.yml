 game_concept_xiongnu_culture_desc: "The ethnic identity of the Xiongnu remains a controversial question involving research in the fields of archaeology, genetics, and linguistics. The least controversial aspect is the genetic analysis; based on autosomal ancestry, the Xiongnu are a heterogeneous group combining influences of the East Asian Slab Grave Culture (ca. 1300-300 BC) and West Eurasian influences, most likely containing elements of the Sakan Pazyryk and Sagly/Uyuk Cultures #P ([Concept('xiongnu_genetic_source','1')|I])#!. Somewhat confounding these findings is the Xiongnu's historic marriage alliances with the Han Chinese, which introduces a high amount of Han Chinese genetic influence in the ruling stratum that was unlikely to have effected the genetic disposition of the common people.\n\nThis, of course does not answer the cultural identification of the Xiongnu themselves, as genetics is not synonymous with culture. Linguistically, several incompatible theories have support among historians, including Turkic, Iranian, Yeniseian, Mongolic, and even a linguistic isolate have varying levels of support. The name Xiongnu itself is a pejorative in Chinese, meaning \"fierce slave\" #P ([Concept('xiongnu_name_note','2')|I])#!, although it is possible that this may be a transliteration of #italic Huna#! or a reference to the Ongi River.\n\nIn reality, the Xiongnu were probably a heterogeneous group within which were probably strong Proto-Turkic and Proto-Mongolic elements. Ultimately, the limitations of game mechanics forces us to make compromises, and given the genetic and (somewhat controversial) cultural links between the Xiongnu and and the Huns, we have chosen to make the Xiongnu a Turkic culture #P ([Concept('xiongnu_genetic_source','1')|I],[Concept('yorulmazoglu_turkic_history','3')|I])#!.

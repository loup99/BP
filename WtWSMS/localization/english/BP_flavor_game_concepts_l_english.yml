The culture existed on Sardinia from at least the XVIIIth Century BC until the Roman Conquest in 238 BC (and possibly until the VIth Century AD in the Barbagia region of Sardinia). While the culture left few written records, extensive material evidence remains of the later Nuragic tribes, the Balares and the Iliensis, as well as records left by surrounding civilizations.\n\nFollowing the Roman Conquest, the islands had considerable settlement from Italy and extensive Romanization, although some tribes, such as the Parati, Sossinati, Balari, and Aconites remained outside Roman control into Imperial times #P ([Concept('strabo_source','1')|I])#! and resisted Christianization until the late VIth Century AD, when Pope Gregory I sent a mission to convert Hospito's tribe in Barbagia."

 game_concept_indo_parthian_proto_culture: "History of Baluchistan"
 game_concept_indo_parthian_proto_culture_desc: "The history of Baluchistan prior to the Arab conquest is poorly documented, in part on account of limited archaeological work in the region. The modern Baluch people are not clearly referenced in history until the VIIIth Century AD #P ([Concept('indo_parthian_source_1','1')|I])#!, and Baluch lore itself argues for an origin with the Arab Conquests #P ([Concept('indo_parthian_source_2','2')|I])#!, so the notion of a Baluch identity is unlikely in Late Antiquity.\n\nGiven the Baluch speak a Northwestern Iranian language, migration of Iranian elements (such as Parthians) seems likely. Indeed, a true identity for the Iranian people of the region might only have arisen during the Caliphate.\n\nGiven the paucity of the information, we assign the culture of Baluchistan for Late Antiquity as Indo-Parthian; the Baluchistan region had been part of the Indian cultural sphere since the Indus Valley Civilization, and the region remained at the cross-roads of both Indian and Iranian influences, for which the Pāratarājas and Paratan was the latest expression prior to beginning of $wtwsms_italic$.\n\n#bold For the purposes of game mechanics, we model Indo-Parthian as a Parthian/Sindhi hybrid#!."

From the legend of Prince Vijaya, and studies of Elu Prakrit, a tentative link between the Sinhalese and proto-Bengalis can be made.\n\nThe legend of Prince Vijaya appears to have at least some basis in fact when reviewing genetic studies of Sri Lankans; studies indicate a link between some Bengali populations and the Sinhalese #P ([Concept('sinhalese_genetics_1','1')|I])#!.

 game_concept_donghu_culture_desc: "The Dong-Hu is a Chinese name meaning \"Eastern Barbarians\" and in particular refers to the nomadic people in what is today northern Heibei, southeastern Inner Mongolia, and western Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang; the terms is contrasted with Xi-hu meaning \"Western Barbarians\". The Donghu were eventually conquered by the Xiongnu under Modu Chanyu (ca. 200-175 BC), and afterwards split into the Wuhuan and Xianbei; the later would become a contributing group that formed the Khitan while the former would play a role in the downfall of the Xiongnu confederacy.\n\n#bold Considering the Chinese links of the Donghu with the later Khitans, in $wtwsms_italic$, we make the Donghu-derived cultures Mongolic heritage and speak various Para-Mongolic languages $controversy_short_note$."
 #Turkic Proto-Cultures
 game_concept_xiongnu_culture: "Xiongnu Ethnogenesis"
 game_concept_xiongnu_culture_short: "several different nomadic pastoralist cultures"
 game_concept_xiongnu_culture_desc: "The ethnic identity of the Xiongnu remains a controversial question involving research in the fields of archaeology, genetics, and linguistics. The least controversial aspect is the genetic analysis; based on autosomal ancestry, the Xiongnu are a heterogeneous group combining influences of the East Asian Slab Grave Culture (ca. 1300-300 BC) and West Eurasian influences, most likely containing elements of the Sakan Pazyryk and Sagly/Uyuk Cultures #P ([Concept('xiongnu_genetic_source','1')|I])#!. Somewhat confounding these findings is the Xiongnu's historic marriage alliances with the Han Chinese, which introduces a high amount of Han Chinese genetic influence in the ruling stratum that was unlikely to have effected the genetic disposition of the common people.\n\nThis, of course does not answer the cultural identification of the Xiongnu themselves, as genetics is not synonymous with culture. Linguistically, several incompatible theories have support among historians, including Turkic, Iranian, Yeniseian, Mongolic, and even a linguistic isolate have varying levels of support. The name Xiongnu itself is a pejorative in Chinese, meaning \"fierce slave\" #P ([Concept('xiongnu_name_note','2')|I])#!, although it is possible that this may be a transliteration of #italic Huna#! or a reference to the Ongi River.\n\nIn reality, the Xiongnu were probably a heterogeneous group within which were probably strong Proto-Turkic and Proto-Mongolic elements. Ultimately, the limitations of game mechanics forces us to make compromises, and given the genetic and (somewhat controversial) cultural links between the Xiongnu and and the Huns, we have chosen to make the Xiongnu a Turkic culture #P ([Concept('xiongnu_genetic_source','1')|I],[Concept('yorulmazoglu_turkic_history','3')|I])#!. By the Vth Century AD, the Xiongnu confederation was no more and the remaining Xiongnu were likely Turkicized (given the remaining Xiongnu people's proximity to major Turkic confederations), so we assign them the Shaz Turkic language."

 game_concept_tiele_culture_desc: "The history of the Turkic peoples prior to the rise of the Göktürk Khaganate is poorly documented. While Chinese sources note the existence of some specific subgroups, such as the Yenisei Kyrgyz (transliterated as Gekun/Ko-Kun/Jiankun/Chien-kun), the main body of what would become the various Common Turkic-speaking Turkish cultures were still in the Altai-Sayan environs in the late Vth Century AD as part of the Tiele (or Chiele) Confederation #P ([Concept('tiele_note','1')|I])#!.

 game_concept_suebi_split_year_desc: "In AD 409, an element of the Suebi under Hermeric crossed the Rhine, as part of a group with the Vandals and Alans. These Suebi settled in Galicia, establishing the Kingdom of the Suebi, centred on Bracara Augusta (modern Braga).\n\n#bold Because technology is closely tied to culture in CK3, we have had to split the Suebi in Galicia into a different culture from the remaining Suebi north of the Danube.#!\n\nThis choice was done to reflect the game mechanics, not necessarily endorsing the idea that the Suebi in Galicia were culturally different from their tribal brethren."
 game_concept_visigothic_split_year: "Visigoth/Goth Split"
 game_concept_visigothic_split_year_desc: "The Goths, by the time they had extensive contacts with the Romans in the IIIrd and IVth Centuries, consisted primarily of two groups:  the Thervingi in the plains north of the lower Danube and the Greuthungi in the Pontic Steppe; the names appear to have been linked to geographic locations.\n\nContingents of both groups would invade Rome during the Gothic War of 376. Under the rule of Alaric, a portion of the Thervingi would go one to sack Rome and establish the Visigothic Kingdom in Gaul.\n\n#bold In $wtwsms_italic$, we have chosen the date of Alaric's conquest of Toulouse and Nabaronne as the formative date for the rise of the Visigoths as a separate culture#!."

What is clear is that Gothic components settled in Thrace and Pannonia following the arrival of the Huns.\n\nIt is under the reign of Valamir in Pannonia that the Ostrogoths coalesced as a separate identity.\n\n#bold In $wtwsms_italic$, we have chosen the date of the Battle of Nedao (which finally broke Hunnic domination) as the formative date for the rise of the Ostrogoths as a separate culture#!."

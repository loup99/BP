 game_concept_clerical_influence_desc: "$game_concept_clerical_influence$ represents the overall influence of the Mazdayasna priests had on the Sasanian State in a way that, while similar, was structurally different than its Roman counterparts. The Mowbeds' influence waxed and waned over the course of the empire, and with it certain powers and traditions morphed alongside it.\n\nIn game, this is represnted by a special realm law applying to the Emperor who has currently vassalized the [faith|E]'s $game_concept_head_of_faith$. Curtailing the Mowbeds' power increases clerical taxation, improves infidel opinion, and gives the Emperor more of a say in who his realm priest should be, while angering your [theocracy|E] [vassals|E] and removing certain powers that an empowered priesthood would have."

 ##Baltics
 game_concept_vistula_veneti_protoculture: "The Vistula Veneti"
 game_concept_vistula_veneti_protoculture_desc: "The association of the Veneti with the Slavs has been a point of contention for centuries, unfortunately not helped by the dearth of written accounts and the ambiguity of the material cultures left behind. In $wtwsms_italic$, we have interpreted the Veneti as a Baltic group, in line with the likely Baltic hydronyms in what is today West Russia and Bealrus.\n\nThe origin of the Slavs remains a constant mystery, with a number of $game_concept_archeological_complex$ argued for or against certain proposals. The only clearly identifiable $game_concept_archeological_complex$ associated with the early Slavs is the later Kyiv Culture.\n\nWith a number of competing proposals, the $wtwsms_italic$ team eventually settled on the Slavic #italic Urheimat#! to be the [cherniakhiv_culture|E]; specifically the interface between Polesia and Chernyakhov, where Gothic, Baltic, and Sarmatian influences would be able to meet $controversy_short_note$. The early Slavic material culture shows influence from all these groups and thus this seems like an acceptable loction for the Slavic #italic Urheimat#! $controversy_short_note$.\n\nWe thus view the Zarubnitsy culture as a related but distinct group from the Przeworsk culture in the Vistula basin as well as related, but distinct, from the Early Slavs.\n\nBecause culture was a far more dynamic concept in reality than #italic Crusader Kings III#! allows us to model, we will note that the material artifacts and cultures were readily borrowed and utilized across a wider horizon than the game can functionally support."
 ##East Germanics
 game_concept_oskywie_culture: "Oxhöft Culture"
 game_concept_oskywie_culture_desc: "The northern portion of the Przeworsk Culture evolved into the Oxhöft culture in the IInd Century BC which continued until the Ist Century AD. Based on the timing, its decline may have been linked to the arrival of the proto-Goths from #italic Scandza#!.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we consider the Oxhöft culture as a progenitor of a number of East Germanic cultures whose migrations seem linked to Gothic arrival in the Vistula basin, such as Gustow and Rygir, or those whose migrations appear contemporaneous with the rise of the Oxhöft Culture, such as the Skirian."
 game_concept_skirian_protohistory: "History of the Skirians"
 game_concept_skirian_protohistory_desc: "The Skirians are one of the most shadowy Germanic peoples of the Late Antique period. Attested to as early as the IInd Century BC, they were linked with the likely Germanic #italic Bastarnae#! from that period, but records remain spotty after their early raiding of Greek Black Sea colonies until teh Hunnic Empire.\n\nSome linguists think the Skirians or #italic Sciri#! were constasted with the #italic Bastarnae#!, with the #italic Sciri#! referencing 'purity or unmixing' while the #italic Bastarnae#! are a referenced to a mixed people, and may thus represent a relatively conservative, Germanic culture contrasting the otherwise hodgepodge of Dacian, Germanic, Celtic, Slavic, and Sarmatian influences in what is now Moldova in the IInd Century BC to the IVth Century AD.\n\nEither way, the Skirians returned to the historical record in the Vth Century with the arrival of the Huns and the displacement of the Goths, and thus whatever their origin, they are at least associated with the later [cherniakhiv_culture|E]."
 game_concept_vandalic_culture_history: "History of the Vandals"
 game_concept_vandalic_culture_history_desc: "The term #italic Vandili#! first appears in recorded history in Pliny's #italic Naturalis Historia#! in the Ist Century AD, as a term designating a large grouping of Germanics, including the Burgundians, Varini, and Gutones. They were also mentioned with the Lugii, another group in the region. As that region is tied to the [przeworsk_complex|E], it is likely that the Lugii were a group related to the Vandals and that the Vandals were at least one component of the Przeworsk $game_concept_archeological_complex$.\n\nBy the second century, at least two distinct Vandal groups - the Silingi and the Hasdingi - appeared in the record. It is, however, the Vandalic migration to Gaul where they clearly became a singular people.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we take the position that the Vandals of the African Kingdom were likely an elite component of the tribes straddling the Carpathian mountains and were forced to migrate with the arrival of the Huns. They are thus a [divergent_culture|E] or Przeworsk with distinctly more Germanic aesthetics $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_burgundian_culture_history: "History of the Burgundians"
 game_concept_burgundian_culture_history_desc: "The origin of the Burgundians is somewhat of a mystery. References to the #italic Burguntes#! and #italic Burgundiones#! in the Ist and IInd Century AD, placing them somewhere near the Vistula or Baltic Sea. In Jordanes #italic Getica#!, he relays a story of the Burgundians almost being annihilated by the Gepids. What is known in history is that the Burgundians appeared on the Roman Rhine border in the late IIIrd Century AD.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we view the Burgundians as a combination of peoples from the [oskywie_culture|E] and the [przeworsk_culture_history|E], both of whom were likely the first to be displaced by the arrival of the Goths on the Vistula. Unlike the other Przeworsk-related groups, the Burgundians elected to travel west instead of down the Vistula, where they entered history slightly earlier.\n\nAs such, we model the Burgundians as a [divergent_culture|E] from Przeworsk, and have them speak $language_vandalic_name$, given their relation with the Przeworsk culture, like the Vandals $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_denziner_culture_history: "History of the Denziner $game_concept_archeological_complex$"
 game_concept_denziner_culture_history_desc: "The Denziner $game_concept_archeological_complex$ represents a divergence from the earlier $wielbark$ period, where influences from the Gustow and Elbe Germanic Peoples. If the 'elite transfer' hypothesis is true, then Denziner may represent an evolution of the $wielbark$ $game_concept_archeological_complex$ that followed the departure of the $wielbark$ leadership from the region, allowing neighboring cultures to more readily dominate former $wielbark$ lands.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model Denziner as a hybrid of Lebus and Wielbark, with the Lebus forming a new ruling group over the former $wielbark$ peoples."
 game_concept_vidivarii_culture_history: "History of the Vidivarii"
 game_concept_vidivarii_culture_history_desc: "The Vidivarii of Jordanes #italic Getica#! are a $game_concept_archeological_complex$ that formed in the Late Vth Century involving an admixture of both $wielbark$ and Baltic practices. It is likely that this formed in some way as a result of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire; perhaps as a back migration of groups into earlier Wielbark lands, or the expansion of West Baltic peoples at the expense of the the former $wielbark_collective_noun$.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model the Vidivarii as a Prussian/$wielbark$ hybrid."
 game_concept_gepid_culture_history: "History of the Gepids"
 game_concept_gepid_culture_history_desc: "The Gepids are one of the more mysterious East Germanic peoples. We have two main sources of information on the Gepids prior to their appearance as a kingdom on the Danube. First, we have some archaeological evidence of Gepid habitation in the area of the Tisza and Koros rivers around AD 350, and Jordanes account of Gepid and Gothic history in #italic Getica#!. While Jordanes account is likely mostly spurious, there may be some truth to them being 'hemmed in by rugged mountains and dense forests'. If the Vandalic Silingi were still in Silesia during the early and middle of the IIIrd Century AD, the Carpathian Mountains would be nestled between both Vandalic groups on either side of the mountains.\n\nWith the flight of the Vandals occurring more-or-less simultaneously with the arrival of the Huns, then it is possible that the Gepids may have either been a peasant component of the Vandals or lived between the two Vandalic groups. The fact that the Gepids fought well and ferociously for the Huns may indicate the former, or if the Vandalic migration was more thorough than an elite transfer it may indicate the later. In either case, the Gepids fully appeared in the historical scene in the IVth Century AD near where their eventual kingdom would form.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model the Gepids as a $wielbark$ [divergent_culture|E] with some aesthetics and ethnic influences from the other peoples of the Carpathian plain $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_heruli_culture_history: "History of the Heruli"
 game_concept_heruli_culture_history_desc: "The Heruli were a Germanic people who were first attested in the late IIIrd century AD, contemporaneously with the Goths an from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, where they engaged in raiding of locales along the Black and Agean Seas. According to #italic Getica#!, they were eventually conquered by Ermanic, the King of the Goths, in the IVth Century AD. Within the Roman Empire, they were noted as effective mercenaries and served throughout the Empire.\n\nWith the arrival of the Huns, elements of the Herlui would fight for both the Romans and the Huns, and some Heruli forces were part of Odovacer's forces during Augustulus' deposition. With the collapse of the Hunnic Empire in 454, the Heruli would secure a polity on the Middle Danube, coalescing there.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, because Heruli names are a mix of Germanic, Iranic, and others, we presume the Heruli to be a mostly Germanic admixture of peoples in the $game_concept_cherniakhiv_complex$."
 game_concept_taifal_culture_history: "History of the Taifals"
 game_concept_taifal_culture_history_desc: "The Taifals are one of the more mysterious peoples of Late Antiquity; they are clearly tied to the Goths, following Cniva's campaigns in Dacia and Moesia in the IIIrd Century AD, but also made excellent cavalrymen, a feature more in common with Sarmatian peoples like the Alans in Gaul in the Vandalic kingdom. They entered the historical record contemporaneously with the Goths and thus originated in the [cherniakhiv_culture|E], like the Goths and Heruli.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model the Taifals as a mixture of $wielbark$ and $sarmatian$, with greater emphasis on the $sarmatian$ contributions $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_gothic_culture_history: "History of the Goths"
 game_concept_gothic_culture_history_desc: "While the ultimate origin of the Goths remains a matter of contention, it is clear that by the IVth Century AD, they were a people associated with the [cherniakhiv_complex|E]. Their migration into Roman territory and its effects on subsequent Roman history were precipitated by the arrival of the Huns, which argues for the Goths being associated, at some level, with the general leadership element of the [cherniakhiv_complex|E] societies.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model the Goths as a [divergent_culture|E] of the $wielbark_collective_noun$, on the basis that we link the expansion of the Wielbark into the [cherniakhiv_complex|E] zone as contemporaneous with the development of the $game_concept_cherniakhiv_complex$ $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_visigothic_culture_history: "History of the Visigoths"
 game_concept_visigothic_culture_history_desc: "The Goths, by the time they had extensive contacts with the Romans in the IIIrd and IVth Centuries, consisted primarily of two groups:  the Thervingi in the plains north of the lower Danube and the Greuthungi in the Pontic Steppe; the names appear to have been linked to geographic locations.\n\nContingents of both groups would invade Rome during the Gothic War of 376. Under the rule of Alaric, a portion of the Thervingi would go one to sack Rome and establish the Visigothic Kingdom in Gaul.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we have chosen the date of Ataulf's settlement of Toulouse and Nabaronne as the formative date for the rise of the Visigoths as a separate culture."
 game_concept_ostrogothic_culture_history: "History of the Ostrogoths"
 game_concept_ostrogothic_culture_history_desc: "The Goths, by the time they had extensive contacts with the Romans in the IIIrd and IVth Centuries, consisted primarily of two groups:  the Thervingi in the plains north of the lower Danube and the Greuthungi in the Pontic Steppe; the names appear to have been linked to geographic locations.\n\nUnlike the Visigoths, the history of the Ostrogoths is more mysterious, but ancient writers such as Jordanes linked the later Ostrogoths with the earlier Greuthungi, in part by linking Ermanic with the later Ostrogothic Amal dynasty. What is clear is that Gothic components settled in Thrace and Pannonia following the arrival of the Huns.\n\nIt is under the reign of Valamir in Pannonia that the Ostrogoths coalesced as a separate identity.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we have chosen the date of the Battle of Nedao (which finally broke Hunnic domination) as the formative date for the rise of the Ostrogoths as a separate culture."
 game_concept_thracian_gothic_culture_history: "History of the Moesogoths"
 game_concept_thracian_gothic_culture_history_desc: "The Goths, by the time they had extensive contacts with the Romans in the IIIrd and IVth Centuries, consisted primarily of two groups:  the Thervingi in the plains north of the lower Danube and the Greuthungi in the Pontic Steppe; the names appear to have been linked to geographic locations.\n\nUnlike the Visigoths, the history of the Moesogoths is more mysterious, but ancient writers such as Jordanes linked the later Ostrogoths and Moesogoths with the earlier Greuthungi, in part by linking Ermanic with the later Ostrogothic Amal dynasty. What is clear is that Gothic components settled in Thrace and Pannonia following the arrival of the Huns.\n\nIt is under the reign of Theodoric Strabo in Thrace that the Moesogoths coalesced as a separate (but related) entity from the Ostrogoths.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we have chosen the date of the Battle of Nedao (which finally broke Hunnic domination) as the formative date for the rise of the Moesogoths as a separate culture."
 game_concept_crimean_gothic_culture_history: "History of the Crimean Goths"
 game_concept_crimean_gothic_culture_history_desc: "The Goths, by the time they had extensive contacts with the Romans in the IIIrd and IVth Centuries, consisted primarily of two groups:  the Thervingi in the plains north of the lower Danube and the Greuthungi in the Pontic Steppe; the names appear to have been linked to geographic locations.\n\nThe history of the Crimean Goths is not well attested and is likely that the Crimean Goths arose from a group of Goths and non-Goths in the aftermath of the Hunnic conquest of the Pontic Steppe #P ([Concept('heather_source','1')])#!.\n\nAs such, we separate the Crimean Goths from the early Goths to represent this ethnogeneis."
 ## Samartian
 game_concept_iazyges_culture_history: "History of the Iazyges"
 game_concept_iazyges_culture_history_desc: "The Iazyges were a Samartian people who first encountered the Roman Empire in the IInd Century BC. For the next 500 years, they lived along the Tisza basin between Pannonia and Dacia. As time went on, the Iazyges both fought with Rome and traded; there's some evidence in the form of Limes Sarmatiae that the Iazyges accepted Roman overlordship in exchange for protection from the encroaching Germanic tribes, with Valentian I engaging in repair work on the Limes before his death.\n\nIn the late Vth Century, a pair of Sarmatian kings, Beuca and Babai would be referenced in #italic Getica#!, indicating the survival of the Pannonian Sarmatians until near the end of the Western Empire."
 ## Slavic
 game_concept_old_slavic_culture_history: "History of the Early Slavs"
 game_concept_old_slavic_culture_history_desc: "The origin of the Slavs is one of the most contentious topics in Indo-European history. Multiple proposals have been advanced, covering almost every location from the Upper Danube to Polesia. Depending on how one reads certain accounts, they could be the 'Scythian Farmers' of Herodotus' time, the Milograd or Chernoles or Zarubintsy or Veneti peoples, and there remain more proposals which we lack the space to list.\n\nUltimately, the precise location will likely never be fully determined and the best we can understand is that the Slavs definitely began appearing on the Roman border around the early VIth Century and by the early IXth century had fully replaced the formerly Germanic peoples east of the Oder.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we have elected to make the Earliest Slavs a component of the [cherniakhiv_complex|E] for three reasons:\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$First, is that the Kyiv culture is the earliest #emp unambiguous#! Slavic $game_concept_archeological_complex$ $controversy_short_note$\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$Second, unambiguous historical references to Slavs only start in the early VIth century, which argues against ethnogeneis in western regions by Roman borders $controversy_short_note$\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$Third, this choice puts the Slavs in a prime position to replace the depleted Germanic cultures of the Vistula, which the transitions from Germanic $przeworsk$ and $wielbark$ seem to be followed by more Slavic $game_concept_archeological_complexes$ $controversy_short_note$.\n\nUltimately, we are aware that one may well argue that another location or $game_concept_archeological_complex$ is more accurately the Early Slavs, but this is the interpretation we use for the purposes of the game mechanics."
 #Notes
 ## East Germanic
 game_concept_cherniakhiv_culture: "Cherniakhiv $game_concept_archeological_complex$"
 game_concept_cherniakhiv_complex: "Cherniakhiv Complex"
 game_concept_cherniakhiv_peoples: "Cherniakhiv Peoples"
 game_concept_cherniakhiv_culture_desc: "The Cherniakhiv culture is a an [archeological_complex|E] that flourished between the IInd to the Vth Centuries AD in parts of modern Ukraine, Romania, Russia, Moldova, and Belarus.\n\nPotentially a multi-ethnic mix of Dacian, Sarmatian, and Gothic peoples, the Cherniakhiv culture is commonly associated with the Goths and related groups, as the earliest unambiguous attestations of the Goths link them to Scythia.\n\nThe decline of the Cherniakhiv culture is associated with the arrival of the Huns in the late IVth Century AD, which coincides with Ermanaric's invasion of Roman territory.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we presume the $game_concept_cherniakhiv_culture$ was a multi-ethnic conglomeration of different peoples with the Goths occupying a nominal position over overlordship, which served as the basis for the story of Oium in #italic Getica#! $controversy_short_note$. As such, there are a number of cultures that derive from it."
 game_concept_przeworsk_culture_history: "Przeworsk $game_concept_archeological_complex$"
 game_concept_przeworsk_complex: "$game_concept_przeworsk_culture_history$"
 game_concept_przeworsk_culture_history_desc: "The Przeworsk culture is an [archeological_complex|E] that existed between the IIIrd Century BC and the Vth Century AD, in what is today the central Oder and Vistula Basins in modern Germany and Poland. It succeeded the earlier Pomeranian culture, which may have likewise been an admixture of Germanic and Baltic cultural influences.\n\nThe most popular view of the Przeworsk culture is that it was a multi-ethnic material culture with Baltic, Celtic, and Germanic influences. The East Germanic Vandals and Lugii are linked to the culture, but were probably only a part of the Archaeological Complex.\n\nBy the late Vth Century AD, the culture was in decline, corresponding with the arrival of the Huns and its subsequent effects on Eastern Europe. Within $wtwsms_italic$, the Przeworsk culture represents the remnant East Germanic component, given the Lugii and Vandals are both closely linked to the specific region Przeworsk occupies."
 game_concept_scandza_culture: "Origins of $wielbark$ $game_concept_archeological_complex$"
 game_concept_wielbark_complex: "$wielbark$ Complex"
 game_concept_scandza_culture_desc: "The $wielbark$ $game_concept_archeological_complex$ represented a change from the previous [przeworsk_complex|E], most notably seen in burial traditions; while the Przeworsk in the pre-$wielbark$ almost always practiced cremation and weapon burials, the $wielbark$ buirals used both inhumation and cremation and rarely utilized weapon burials; the distinction between the two changed as $wielbark$ and Przeworsk began to borrow from it each other. The $wielbark$ culture also practiced erecting stone circles and stelae, a practice shared with the Scandinavian cultures to the North.\n\nIn #italic Getica#!, Jordanes relates that the Goths came to the continent from Scandza. The noticeable change in material practices in the region and the stelae raising seem to indicate that $wielbark$ represented an influx of new settlers to the region from Scandinavia, and thus the $wielbark$ are likely linked to the ethnogensis of the Goths in the interactions of the early [cherniakhiv_culture|E] with the $wielbark$ culture.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we link the #italic Gutones#! of early Roman accounts as well as the later $game_concept_cherniakhiv_culture$. As such, the $wielbark$ culture represents the peasant portion of Gothic culture, before the elite section migrated to the Black Sea Region."

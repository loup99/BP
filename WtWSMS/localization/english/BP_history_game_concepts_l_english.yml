 game_concept_vistula_veneti_protoculture: "The Vistula Veneti"
 game_concept_vistula_veneti_protoculture_desc: "The association of the Veneti with the Slavs has been a point of contention for centuries, unfortunately not helped by the dearth of written accounts and the ambiguity of the material cultures left behind. In $wtwsms_italic$, we have interpreted the Veneti as a Baltic group, in line with the likely Baltic hydronyms in what is today West Russia and Bealrus.\n\nThe origin of the Slavs remains a constant mystery, with a number of $game_concept_archeological_complex$ argued for or against certain proposals. The only clearly identifiable $game_concept_archeological_complex$ associated with the early Slavs is the later Kyiv Culture.\n\nWith a number of competing proposals, the $wtwsms_italic$ team eventually settled on the Slavic #italic Urheimat#! to be the [cherniakhiv_culture|E]; specifically the interface between Polesia and Chernyakhov, where Gothic, Baltic, and Sarmatian influences would be able to meet $controversy_short_note$. The early Slavic material culture shows influence from all these groups and thus this seems like an acceptable loction for the Slavic #italic Urheimat#! $controversy_short_note$.\n\nWe thus view the Zarubnitsy culture as a related but distinct group from the Przeworsk culture in the Vistula basin as well as related, but distinct, from the Early Slavs.\n\nBecause culture was a far more dynamic concept in reality than #italic Crusader Kings III#! allows us to model, we will note that the material artifacts and cultures were readily borrowed and utilized across a wider horizon than the game can functionally support."

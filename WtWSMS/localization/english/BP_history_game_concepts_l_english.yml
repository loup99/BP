 ##### Cultures #####
 game_concept_babylonian_culture: "Assyro-Babylonian Culture"
 game_concept_babylonian_culture_desc: "The demographics of Asoristan during the Late Antique and Early Middle Ages is difficult to parse. Because of the large-scale population transfers of the Assyrian Empire and later demographic pressure, the old Akkadian speakers of Southern Mesopotamia eventually adopted Aramaic as a common tongue by the Ist Century AD. Southern Mesopotamia remained especially diverse, both religiously and culturally, with large numbers of Manicheans, Pagans, and Mandeans among the mostly Christian population and a combination of Persian aristocrats, Nabatean traders, and Arab nomands.\n\nWhile large numbers of pagans also existed in the north, the diversity of north Asoristan was not as great as the south. Additionally, the northern part of Asoristan was the historic heartland of the Assyrian peoples, who have had a cultural continuity from the ancient Assyrian Empire to the modern day. \n\nBecause of the difference in both terrain and culture, we divide the Aramaic-speaking population of Asoristan into two cultures:  an Assyrian population in the North and a \"Chaldean\" population in the south. Functionally, the two groups were somewhat hard to separate, and as such, cultures with Aramean or Assyrian Traditions have a higher [cultural_acceptance|E] baseline than they would otherwise have.\n\nThe use of the term \"Chaldean\" for the Armaic speakers of Southern Mesopotamia is dated and #italic somewhat#! inaccurate, but we use it for lack of a better term $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_balaskan_culture: "Balaskan Culture"
 game_concept_balaskan_culture_desc: "The cultural makeup of the region that would be known as Balaskan is sparsely attested. It is known that a (likely) Caucasian peoples referred to as the Caspians (#italic Káspioi#! in Greek and #italic Kaspk'#! in Armenian) inhabited the region through the Achaemenid period, but by the IInd Century were extinct #P ([Concept('strabo_caspian_source','1')])#!. The region was then most likely a hodgepodge of Iranic, Aghwan, and Armenian peoples #P ([Concept('paytakaran_source','2')])#!.\n\nThe extents of Balasagan (or Balasakan in Armenian) is also somehwat fuzzy, but likely included the Mugan Plain and what is today the Shirvan region. By the Late Antique period, the actual identity of the people in the region is somewhat unclear; Shapur I referred to the region as Iranian in his conquests, but Kartir would later refer to them as un-Iranian. During the Armenian rebellion of 450-1, the King of Balasgan would fight against the Christian Armenians but would in turn revolt against the Persians, raising questions of orientation. Furthermore, there are references to Balasgan being related to the Caucasian Albanians, at least before the Peace of 387.\n\nThis conundrum leaves the rather prosperous and valuable Balaskan region in somewhat of a quandary. As a means of resolving these historical discrepancies, we make Balasgan culture a mix of Aghwan and Adhari, using the Adhari ethos and language, but retaining a Caucasian heritage. This mixture should, in part, justify the confusing identification of Balsagan as both belonging to and #bold not#! belonging to Iran, in the sense that Kartir and Shapur I would use the terms $controversy_short_note$. The choice of Adhari is in line with the notion that Old Azeri, which spanned the region of modern Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan, was a Northwestern Iranic language, part of the same continuum as Adhari in $wtwsms_italic$ $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_bolghar_culture: "Origin of the Bolghars"
 game_concept_bolghar_culture_desc: "Like the Huns, the origin of the Bolghars is somewhat of a mystery. Given the earliest attestation of Bolghar-related groups in the mid-Vth Century AD, they likely arrived as part of the Turkic migration into Europe, spearheaded by the Huns.\n\n#bold As such, for the purposes of game mechanics, we make the Bolghars a divergent culture of the Xiongnu with an origin in the mid-IIIrd Century AD#!"
 game_concept_brahui_culture: "Brahui Ethnogeneis"
 game_concept_brahui_culture_desc: "The existence of the Dravidian-speaking Brahui within a larger population of Indo-Iranian speaking peoples is a mystery. Some scholars posit the Brahui were part of a migration to the region (sometime within the last 3 millennia #P ([Concept('brahui_source_iranica','1')|I])#!)#!, while others argue that the Brahui represent a relic population, considering no significant genetic difference between the Brahui and their Indo-Iranian neighbours #P ([Concept('brahui_source_genetics','2')|I])#!)#!.\n\n#bold Within $wtwsms_italic$, we choose to model the Brahui as a relic population and as such, the Brahui are an Iranian heritage culture $controversy_short_note$, which matches their own self-identification as Balochs #P ([Concept('brahui_source_iranica','1')|I])#!)#!."

What is known in history is that the Burgundians appeared on the Roman Rhine border in the late IIIrd Century AD.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we view the Burgundians as a combination of peoples from the [oskywie_culture|E] and the [przeworsk_culture_history|E], both of whom were likely the first to be displaced by the arrival of the Scandzans on the Vistula. Unlike the other Przeworsk-related groups, the Burgundians elected to travel west instead of down the Vistula, where they entered history slightly earlier.\n\nAs such, we model the Burgundians as a [divergent_culture|E] from Przeworsk, and have them speak $language_vandalic_name$, given their relation with the Przeworsk culture, like the Vandals $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_carpodaci_culture: "History of the Later Dacians"
 game_concept_carpodaci_culture_desc: "The history of the Dacians after Constantine I dispersed many of the Carpi within the empire is poorly attested. The \"Free Dacians\", or those Dacians that remained outside Rome's control, likely did not simply vanish with the withdrawl of Rome from the Dacian region. Roman Dacia abutted both the [cherniakhiv_complex|E] and [przeworsk_complex|E] in the Late Antique period, especially during the time when these two archeological cultures collided and influenced each other.\n\nBy the late IVth Century, as the Huns began pushing the Alans and Goths into the Empire, some reports of #italic Karpodakai#! raiding with the Sciri and other Germanics, but this is mostly from Zosimus, whose accuracy is a matter of debate. However, it seems plausible that the remnant Dacians, even if they lost their political independence, retained at least some continued cultural existence in the Dacian region, given that there exists a relative dearth of information about the situation in former Roman Dacia from the withdrawl of the Romans and the arrival of the Slavs in the early VIth century.\n\nAs such, we model these remnant Dacians as extant into the late Vth century, although lacking much in the way of political or military might $controversy_short_note$."

 game_concept_denziner_culture_history: "History of the Denziner $game_concept_archeological_complex$"

 game_concept_galatian_culture_desc: "The Galatians were a Celtic peoples who invaded Asia Minor in the IIIrd Century BC and settled in the region of what is now Ankara. While they retained a number of Celtic practices, by the Late Antique period, they had become a somewhat Hellenized people, somewhat indistinguishable from the other Anatolian peoples (who themselves were undergoing Hellenization).n\n#bold As such, for the purposes of game mechanics, we make the Galatians a hybrid Gallic-Phrygian culture to prevent hybridization between the long-settled Galatians and the native Anatolian peoples $controversy_short_note$#!."
 game_concept_gepid_culture_history: "History of the Gepids"
 game_concept_gepid_culture_history_desc: "The Gepids are one of the more mysterious East Germanic peoples. We have two main sources of information on the Gepids prior to their appearance as a kingdom on the Danube. First, we have some archaeological evidence of Gepid habitation in the area of the Tisza and Koros rivers around the late IVth Century, and Jordanes account of Gepid and Gothic history in #italic Getica#!. While Jordanes account is likely mostly spurious, there may be some truth to them being 'hemmed in by rugged mountains and dense forests'. If the Vandalic Silingi were still in Silesia during the early and middle of the IIIrd Century AD, the Carpathian Mountains would be nestled between both Vandalic groups on either side of the mountains.\n\nWith the flight of the Vandals occurring more-or-less simultaneously with the arrival of the Huns, then it is possible that the Gepids may have either been a peasant component of the Vandals or lived between the two Vandalic groups. The fact that the Gepids fought well and ferociously for the Huns may indicate the former, or if the Vandalic migration was more thorough than an elite transfer it may indicate the later. In either case, the Gepids fully appeared in the historical scene in the IVth Century AD near where their eventual kingdom would form.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model the Gepids as a $wielbark$ [divergent_culture|E] with some aesthetics and ethnic influences from the other peoples of the Carpathian plain $controversy_short_note$."

Their migration into Roman territory and its effects on subsequent Roman history were precipitated by the arrival of the Huns, which argues for the Goths being associated, at some level, with the general leadership element of the [cherniakhiv_complex|E] societies.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model the Goths as a [divergent_culture|E] of the $wielbark_collective_noun$, on the basis that we link the expansion of the Wielbark into the [cherniakhiv_complex|E] zone as contemporaneous with the development of the $game_concept_cherniakhiv_complex$ $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_heruli_culture_history: "History of the Heruli"
 game_concept_heruli_culture_history_desc: "The Heruli were a Germanic people who were first attested in the late IIIrd century AD, contemporaneously with the Goths an from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, where they engaged in raiding of locales along the Black and Agean Seas. According to #italic Getica#!, they were eventually conquered by Ermanic, the King of the Goths, in the IVth Century AD. Within the Roman Empire, they were noted as effective mercenaries and served throughout the Empire.\n\nWith the arrival of the Huns, elements of the Herlui would fight for both the Romans and the Huns, and some Heruli forces were part of Odovacer's forces during Augustulus' deposition. With the collapse of the Hunnic Empire in 454, the Heruli would secure a polity on the Middle Danube, coalescing there.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, because Heruli names are a mix of Germanic, Iranic, and others, we presume the Heruli to be a mostly Germanic admixture of peoples in the $game_concept_cherniakhiv_complex$ $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_hunas_culture: "Origin of the Huna people"
 game_concept_hunas_culture_desc: "Huna is an Indian name to a group of Central Asian tribes who entered the Indian subcontinent in the Vth and VIth Centuries AD. The precise origins of these people is a matter of debate, although it appears that the Hepthalites, Xionites, Kidarites, and others were a set of related people.\n\nBoth textual (e.g., the colour white being tied to the southern direction) would indicate a Turkic influence #P ([Concept('yorulmazoglu_turkic_history','1')|I])#!, while the extensive use of Bactrian in official correspondence would indicate Iranian influence or fusion with local elements, possibly being adopted as a native language after a period of settlement.\n\nMost likely, like the Xiongnu, the various Huna peoples were a heterogeneous group that included a number of elements. For those Ancient Indian sources identify as Huna, they were likely part of a period of migration in the IVth Century AD in response to climatic changes in Northern Eurasia.\n\n#bold For the purposes of game mechanics, we make the Hunas culture a Xiognu/Bactrian Hybrid.#!"

 game_concept_hunnic_culture_desc: "The origin and ethnic identification of the European Huns is a matter of continuing debate among scholars, ever since Joseph de Guingnes proposed a link between the Xiongnu and the Huns.\n\nA number of arguments support a connection between the Northern Xiongnu and the various Hunnic peoples, including genetics and textual analysis; however, the general dearth of hard data makes it difficult to determine the ethnic identity of the Huns and Huna peoples. The genetic evidence does point to a clear genetic link between the Hunnic and Xiongnu people, but this does not implicitly prove a cultural identification #P ([Concept('hunnic_genetics_1','1')|I],[Concept('hunnic_genetics_2','2')|I])#!.\nCertain textual clues point to a Turkic connection, but these remain somewhat limited in size and scope.\n\nUltimately, we suspect that the Huns were a heterogeneous group with a strong Turkic ruling component and choose to represent the European Huns as a descendent culture form the Xiongnu $controversy_short_note$. To account for the genetic evidence, the Hunnic ethnicity map accounts for a combination of Xiongnu, Scytho-Sarmatian, and Gothic elements. The linguistic affiliation remains the least documented, but because of the association of the Bolghars and Huns, have made Hunnic a Turkic language of the Oghuric branch $controversy_short_note$."
 game_concept_iazyges_culture_history: "History of the Iazyges"
 game_concept_iazyges_culture_history_desc: "The Iazyges were a Samartian people who first encountered the Roman Empire in the IInd Century BC. For the next 500 years, they lived along the Tisza basin between Pannonia and Dacia. As time went on, the Iazyges both fought with Rome and traded; there's some evidence in the form of Limes Sarmatiae that the Iazyges accepted Roman overlordship in exchange for protection from the encroaching Germanic tribes, with Valentian I engaging in repair work on the Limes before his death.\n\nIn the late Vth Century, a pair of Sarmatian kings, Beuca and Babai would be referenced in #italic Getica#!, indicating the survival of the Pannonian Sarmatians until near the end of the Western Empire, near Sirmium."

 game_concept_khuni_culture_desc: "The North Caucasian Huns, or Khuni, are a group of alleged Hunnic peoples who existed in the North Caucasus during the Late Antique period, presumed to be linked to the Huns of Eastern Europe, mostly (and unambiguously) in Armenian records. They had a polity somewhere in what is today Daghestan, and were a target of a missionary effort by the Armenians in the VIth and VIIth centuries.

 game_concept_mauretanian_identity_desc: "The Amazigh identity remained present throughout the period of Roman rule and Africa and Mauritania underwent a different process of Romanization than the was seen in, say, southern Hispania or Southern Gaul. The urban and coastal cores underwent extensive Romanization and were viewed as Roman, but the agricultural hinterland was far less affected, which led to a variety of post-Roman Amazigh polities being established following the collapse of Roman rule during the Vandal Conquest in the middle of the Vth Century.\n\nIn $wtwsms_italic$, we model this complexity by making the Amazigh peoples who were under extensive Roman control a hybrid culture of Romano-African and Numidian, while retaining an Amazigh heritage and language $controversy_short_note$. This prevents hybridization with Romano-African while maintaining a core Amazigh identity.\n\nAs was noted in \"[proto_north_berber_culture|E]\", the Romans used a variety of names for the aboriginal inhabitants of Numida and Mauritania. As Mauri was clearly used for both the independent tribes beyond Roman control in Mauritania, that name cannot be used for this separate, Numidian-derived culture.

Somewhat confounding these findings is the Xiongnu's historic marriage alliances with the Han Chinese, which introduces a high amount of Han Chinese genetic influence in the ruling stratum that was unlikely to have effected the genetic disposition of the common people.\n\nThis, of course does not answer the cultural identification of the Xiongnu themselves, as genetics is not synonymous with culture. Linguistically, several incompatible theories have support among historians, including Turkic, Iranian, Yeniseian, Mongolic, and even a linguistic isolate have varying levels of support. The name Xiongnu itself is a pejorative in Chinese, meaning \"fierce slave\" #P ([Concept('xiongnu_name_note','a')|I])#!, although it is possible that this may be a transliteration of #italic Huna#! or a reference to the Ongi River.\n\nIn reality, the Xiongnu were probably a heterogeneous group within which were probably strong Proto-Turkic and Proto-Mongolic elements.

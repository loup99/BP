TODO Beta:
* Make Jewish High Priesthood chars have actual patrilinearity
* Make Samaritan High Priesthood chars have actual patrilinearity
* Implement full Herodian history
* Make Symmachus' chars use different IDs that are less clunky

Organized in a way to _try_ and make backporting to CK2 possible.
* culture.txt - chars from CK2
* culture_ck3.txt - chars new to CK3
* culture_ck3_fictional.txt - chars new to CK3 that are fictional but relatively important placeholder
* culture_ck3_fictional_tribals.txt - chars in CK3 that exist to fill the map; overwrite liberally

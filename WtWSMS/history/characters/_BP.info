TODO Beta:
* Make Jewish High Priesthood chars have actual patrilinearity
* Make Samaritan High Priesthood chars have actual patrilinearity
* Implement full Herodian history
* Make Symmachus' chars use different IDs that are less clunky

For new general characters, convention should be <Culture>Char100+, so start numbering at 100

		While it's not greatly sorted, it does fall in line with other sources I've found, including old WtWSMS

Horn of Africa
--------------
Sidamic is the grab-bag non-Amhara/Tigre/Tigryna Ethiopics present before Amhara et al spread south.
waaqism_pagan is Oromo-Somali, so moved to appropriate cultures
Cleaned up Welayata based on this map (with some guestimations and back-projections)

For aa general idea of the locations of Cushtic/Omotic speakers, this map is useful:

Balts & Slavs
--------------
Kolochin distribution based on [1,2]
Dneipner Balts placed at the headwaters of the Pripyat, Dneipner, and Neman Rivers
Aesti extended into the Dvinia headwaters; some references to Aesti fights with the Slavs around Polotsk [3]
Sudovians have early attestation by Ptolemy and seem to have been present as far South as the Bug and as far west as Brest [2]

Slavs, Slavs, Slavs
--------------
Antes/Sklaveni border was as always, very fuzzy.
Most popular theory seems to be Sklaveni were associated with the Korchak culture and the Antae with
the Penkovka culture.

Some associated maps:

      From https://indo-european.eu/2021/02/germanic-runes-in-the-prague-type-pottery-culture/
      which is quoting https://e-journals.ku.lt/journal/AB/article/1669/info

Both are slightly anachronistic for us as by 476, it is unlikely that Slavisation was underway.
however, it does provide a useful bondary between where to put the Sklaveni and Antes for 476.
So we should stick with the Sklaveni ruling over Baltic Veneti, Dnieper Baltic and Slavic regions

Alamannians
--------------
Settlement in 476 based on "Alamanni and Sueben" by Holger Munzer (1975); later settlement in the more
modern Alamannic Germanic regions a result of Frankish encroachment

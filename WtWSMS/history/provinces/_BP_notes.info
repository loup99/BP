General Map Notes:

Asia Minor
-------------------
Phrygian moved be more centred on "New Phrygian" inscriptions and further from the Pontus

		While it's not greatly sorted, it does fall in line with other sources I've found, including old WtWSMS

Horn of Africa
--------------
Sidamic is the grab-bag non-Amhara/Tigre/Tigryna Ethiopics present before Amhara et al spread south.
waaqism_pagan is Oromo-Somali, so moved to appropriate cultures
Cleaned up Welayata based on this map (with some estimations and back-projections)

For aa general idea of the locations of Cushtic/Omotic speakers, this map is useful:

Balts & Slavs
--------------
Kolochin distribution based on [1,2]
Dneipner Balts placed at the headwaters of the Pripyat, Dneipner, and Neman Rivers
Aesti extended into the Dvinia headwaters; some references to Aesti fights with the Slavs around Polotsk [3]
Sudovians have early attestation by Ptolemy and seem to have been present as far South as the Bug and as far west as Brest [2]

Slavs, Slavs, Slavs
--------------
Antes/Sklaveni border was as always, very fuzzy.
Most popular theory seems to be Sklaveni were associated with the Korchak culture and the Antae with
the Penkovka culture.

Some associated maps:

      From https://indo-european.eu/2021/02/germanic-runes-in-the-prague-type-pottery-culture/
      which is quoting https://e-journals.ku.lt/journal/AB/article/1669/info

Both are slightly anachronistic for us as by 476, it is unlikely that Slavisation was underway.
however, it does provide a useful boundary between where to put the Sklaveni and Antes for 476.
So we should stick with the Sklaveni ruling over Baltic Veneti, Dnieper Baltic and Slavic regions

Alamannians
--------------
Settlement in 476 based on "Alamanni and Sueben" by Holger Munzer (1975); later settlement in the more
modern Alamannic Germanic regions a result of Frankish encroachment

Gaulia
--------------
Border between Gauls and Germans (Pre-Roman conquest); probable border for Romano-Gauls.

Gaullic Alans:
Given Alan support for Jovinus in Germania Inferior, it seems likely they were granted land as
early as 406, but we only have attestation of Aetius granting land to Goar's Alans in 442

[2] Outlines toponymic evidence for Alanian settlement, especially concentrated from Orleans to Evereux
(Map 4), with additional settlement around Rheims/Soissons/Metz region (Map 3).

[1] Alans played a role in the development of Frankish cavalry.

[1] - pg. 126:
"... the Alan cavalry so dominated the military of Armorica that their influence was recognizable there at least into
the Xth century and probably into the twelfth century."

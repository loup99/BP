#LT-Rascek: The Ostrogothic situation is horribly complicate; I've based this on what I've pieced together
#from the PLRE Vol 2 Fl. Theodoricus 7 plus discussions with Loup:
# * 473: Theodemer initiates a Migration towards Macedonia
# * 474: Theodemer dies and Theodoric succeeds him, having captued Vlpiana and Stobi, then Heraclea Lyncestis
#        and Larissa.
# * 476: The Ostrogoths were at Novae in Moesia Inferior (PLRE says they remained there until 478/479 and
#        resettled again in 483.
# * 476: Zeno seeks and obtains Theodric's support for throne reclaimation, gaining Patricianhood,
#        Magister Militum Praesentalis, and symbolic adoption by Zeno. The titles had to come after
#        August because that's when Zeno became Emperor again. Adoption is NLT 478.
#
# So by late 476 (after the February Bookmark), the Ostrogoths get a small land parcel in Macedonia

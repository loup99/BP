2023-XX-XX v0.1.4
-----------

Mechanics:
- Improved CCU model:
   - Languages:
      - Introduced notion of dialect continua to provide more granularity to languages
         - A language can have multiple continua, helping provide a better model for languages at the lowest levels
      - Introduce notion of creoles to allow genetically unrelated languages to have some degree of relation to each other
   - Heritages:
      - Allowed heritages to have multiple heritage groups and families, in line with the generally fuzzy notion of what a heritage is
      - Added "Kulturbund" concept to capture the relative heritage closeness of some heritages that are still distinct
         - Example: Altaic Kulturbund for Turkic and Mongolic heritage, Scythian Kulturbund for Sarmatian and Scythian heritages
- Implemented heritage and language drift events to model the evolution of culture and language during the period
  - Implemented for Latin heritage and languages
  - Implemented for Indo-Aryan languages
- Integrated Nezaros' Minority system and adapted it to WtWSMS
  - Added new minority map modes to be able to see distribution of minorities on the map
  - Integrated with council tasks
    - "Promote Culture" and "Convert County" tasks increase minority level by one (none -> small minority -> large minority -> majority)
    - By default, the tasks will continue until the majority of the county is changed
  - Integrated with Migrations
    - Instead of county modifiers, migrations (major and minor) will spawn minorities based on development and migration type
- Integrated Typical's Tributary system and adapted it to WtWSMS
  - Disabled tributary income at the moment, as the tributary income system is broken
  - General Changes:
    - Tributaries can call their suzerain to war if being attacked by an external power via decision
    - Suzerain can always call tributaries to war via decision
    - Made it possible to refuse a suzerain call to arms, breaking the tribute contract and making tributaries target-able with punitive CBs (reinforce Tribute and depose the punished ruler)
    - Made it possible to refuse a tributary's call to arms, breaking the tribute contract
  - New Tributary Types:
    - Foederatus Tributary
      - A permanent tributary, but (ai) will never refuse a call to arms, either as a foederatus or a suzerain
      - Has some additional modifiers for this tribute type
      - Created "Right to Rule" interaction for Roman Emperors with federates
        - Enables foederatus to conquer former Roman lands as if Roman Successor
        - Costs 1000 prestige for the Emperor but grants a 100 year truce (preventing raiding, among other things)

Bookmarks:
- Added New "Rise of the White Huns" bookmark to 476 group

Causus Belli:
- Minor Migrations

  - The player's capital now gets a small minority of the player's faith and culture if successful

  - An event now fires a few days after winning a war, allowing players to choose keeping their old government or adopting new ones
- Major migrations
  - Counties still have a chance to flip to the migrator's culture & faith
  - If not, there's a chance to spawn large or small minorities
  - The probability of these minorities spawning is inversely related to the county's development
  - Removed some of the old modifiers that allowed rapid conversion for a limited time
  - An event now fires a few days after winning a war, allowing players to choose keeping their old government or adopting new ones
- Extended Sub-Roman reconquest CB to Federates with "Right to Rule" character modifier

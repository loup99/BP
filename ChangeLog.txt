Next v0.1.1
-----------

Religion:
* Tib is a holy site for Mandeans, replacing Farz
* Assur, Ninive are holy sites for Assyrian Pagans; new holy sites are Assur, Ninive, Harran, Baghdad, and Sinjar
* Monophysitism gets Apostolic succession to enable potential Autocephaly like in CK2

Culture:
* Frankish Traditions get 50% MAA maintenance cost (can't currently make that only prestige cost)
* Indian Language Union extended to Meitei, Kachari languages
* Taifals have Concubines Tradition like other Christian Germans

Map:
* Some city name improvements
   - Takrit is Birtha for Greeks
* Takrit is Assyrian culture
* Updated Sitifensis religious distribution

Casus Belli:
* Roman Successor Reconquests are available again for hefty prices.
* Advanced Governments (Sub-Roman, Bureaucratic, Gubernatorial, Gupta, and Eranshar) have access to De Jure and Claim conquests

Localization:
* Added missing Assyrian Pagan Localization for Assyrian Paganism
* Some additional localization polish (making some adjectives proper adjectives)

Other:
* Tweaked WtWSMS default game rule conversion values slightly
* Updated Credits for more proper names and catching some contributors I missed
* Updated music with new version of "From the Hills", courtesy of Christian Szajna and TJ Moran (lead cello)

Major Bugfixes:
* Custom characters will not yield feudalism; on account of how CK3 works, on day 1 the character will be feudal. Day 2, it will revert to the previous government. We will continue to investigate how to mitigate this in the GUI in the future.
* Fixed bug in minor aristocracy time being 50 instead of 25 years
* Colonizers/Romance Culture/Hellenizers/Hellenic Culture traditions should be selectable so long as the resulting hybrid has the appropriate heritage
* High Tribals may build/use tribal buildings now
* Custom titles are creatable under most circumstances; the Franks must still try to make Francia while the Goths need to try to make Empire of the Goths. Will look into making a game rule to disable this in future releases.
* Sub-Romans should not get every feudal transition event a the same time anymore
* Conversion to High Tribalism no longer requires a reformed faith (as faith reformation is innovation locked)

Minor Bugfixes:
* Many localization typo corrections
* Fixed an issue with monolithic culture triggers
* Fixed some incorrect ages in bookmarks for character dna
* Fixed some wonkiness in the Arascid dynasty by making Phriaptes an Arascid
* Fixed duplicate Creones/Western Isles duchy
* Catholicism/Orthodoxy won't appear as a result of stress anymore
* Liege's may demand settled vassals convert (if the liege has State Religion)
* "As I Lay Dying" event should no longer occur (for now)
* Trier instead of Turin is one of the valid capitals for re-establishing the Roman Empire
* Fixed Empire of Gaul creation trigger so it's available to human players
* Graphics bugs in Chur and Barcelona should be fixed
* Sub-Romans can retract vassals

2024-04-17 v.0.1.5
-----------
General:
- Update the mod to Vanilla 1.12.4

Defines & Game Rules:
- Added default game rule slowing hybrid and divergence
- Reduced a number of hard-coded defines, slowing the growth of cultural acceptance
- Added game rule restricting the creation of de jure titles if the ruler's primary title is titular; off by default and has an "AI only" variant as well.

New Mechanics:
- The Senate:
   - Created two Senate institutions, with Roman and Constantinopolitan Senates, instead of having them on the map as a title
   - The institution is interactable through the GUI as a new menu item
   - Senate Interactions:
      - Request Recognition:
         - An event fires several days after taking the Senate Seat, where the Consul requests that you request Senatorial recognition
         - You can Accept, Ignore the Senate, or Stall; all actions costing prestige and confering modifiers
         - After that event, players may request through the GUI that the Senate recognize them if they chose to stall instead of making a decision
      - Rather than a decision, players may disestablish the Senate in the GUI if they are not a Roman-type culture or a Roman government
   - Senatorial Recognition:
      - Getting the recognition of the Senate confers a modifier which negates short-reign penalties, at the cost of prestige, but also gains an opinion bump with Senators
      - Ignoring the Senate gains one prestige at the cost of an opinion malus with Senators
      - Stalling the Senate hurts one's opinion with Senators, and each new consul will both the Senate Seat top liege, requesting that they seek the approval of the Senate
   - Senate Character Interactions:
      - The top liege of the Senate seat (Rome or Constantinople for East and West, respectively) and the consul may use Senate Interactions
      - They may nominate a new Senator from characters in the "Senatorial Regions" around the Senate Seats or within the top liege of the Senate Holder's realm
      - They may elevate dynasties to join the ranks of the senate
      - The top liege of the Senate Seat may also nominate the next consul
      - However, Senators react negatively to such interference by the top holder and such actions give negative opinion modifiers and cost variable prestige (depending on the nominee's traits and standing)
   - Senatorial Families:
      - Senatorial families have some implicit modifiers, granting prestige gain for dynasty members as well as bolstering diplomacy and intrigue
      - Senatorial families expect to have a certain number of non-capital (or capital) baronies in their family
      - Senatorial family dynasts will bother the holder of the Senate seat if their family has fewer holdings than desired
         - Accepting grants a random non-capital barony to the Senator's family at the cost of aggrivating vassals
         - Refusing irritates the whole Senate
   - Traits and Modifiers:
      - Senators for both the East and West have traits which denote their membership and provide some prestige gain
      - The Consuls have a character modifier indicating their consulship
      - Previous Consuls have a trait indicating their prior consulship
      - These Traits have additional, culture-related modifiers
   - Senate leadership is elected yearly
      - The Senate will behave somewhat autonomously, electing Consuls every January, or sooner if the consul dies mid-term, from among their ranks
      - Players may nominate Consuls if they hold the Senate Seat, annoying the Senate but giving their nominee prestige and renown, as well as making them next consul
   - Senate and Title Revocation:
      - Revoking non-capital baronies from Senators _without a revocation_ reason angers all Senators
      - Applies even for bureaucratic and gubernatorial governments (who otherwise have very liberal revocation rules)
      - This does not extend to Senators with counties or greater
   - Either of the Senates may collapse if no senator is available to maintain the Senate's functions
   - Rajamandala and Eranshahr governments cannot request interact with the Senate, as they function under very different understanding of universality than the Roman Empire
   - Senatorial approval and disapproval comes with legitimacy gain and loss, modified by government type, held titles, and culture features
- Title Creation:
   - Titular Cultural Titles and related concepts removed
   - Holding only Titular Kingdoms or Empires prevents you from creating de jure kingdoms and empires
   - Added a decision for making titular Kingdoms into de jure Kingdoms for characters who cannot establish Roman empires, or for land outside the Roman Empire
      - Only available to non-tribal, non-nomad, non-Gubernatorial governments
      - Requirements:
        - Have held the duchy in which the capital county resides for at least 30 years
        - Complete control of at least two duchies within the same de jure kingdom, one of which is the capital duchy
        - The capital duchy is your culture and faith
        - Your culture has Social Stratification and Writing Innovations
        - Legitimacy Level of 3
        - Prestige Level of 5
        - Maximum Crown-Type Authority if government has it, or sufficient fedualization for Sub-Roman governments
   - Added a decision for replacing de jure Roman Provinces with titular Kingdoms for characters who can establish Roman empires, for land within the Roman Empire
      - Similar to the above, but requires complete control of the associated kingdom
      - Prestige prices increases quadratically with the degree of feudalization in the Realm
      - Also requires Legal Codex Innovation
   - Added a decision for making titular Empires de jure
   - Added a decision for making titular Roman Empires de jure

2022-09-11 v0.1.1
-----------

- Update for 1.7.0 

Religion:
- Tib is a holy site for Mandeans, replacing Farz
- Assur, Ninive are holy sites for Assyrian Pagans; new holy sites are Assur, Ninive, Harran, Baghdad, and Sinjar

Localization:
- Added missing Assyrian Pagan Localization for Assyrian Paganism

Other:

- Updated credits for more proper names and catching some contributors that had been missed
- Updated music with new version of "From the Hills", courtesy of Christian Szajna and TJ Moran (lead cello)

Major Bugfixes:
- Custom characters will not yield feudalism; on account of how CK3 works, on day 1 the character will be feudal. Day 2, it will revert to the previous government. We will continue to investigate how to mitigate this in the GUI in the future.
- Fixed bug in minor aristocracy time being 50 instead of 25 years
- Colonizers/Romance Culture/Hellenizers/Hellenic Culture traditions should be selectable so long as the resulting hybrid has the appropriate heritage

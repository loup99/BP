Next v0.1.4
-----------

Mechanics:
- Integrated Typical's Tributary system and adapted it to WtWSMS
	- Tributary Changes:
			- Tributaries can call their suzerain to war if being attacked by an external power
			- Suzerain can always call tributaries to war
			- No tributary income currently as the system is bugged and requires major overhaul to work
			- Made it possible to refuse a suzerain call to arms, breaking the tributary contract and making tributaries target-able with punitive CBs
	- Suzerain Changes:
			- Made it possible to refuse a tributary's call to arms, breaking the tributary contract (which does not grant a punitive CB option)
	- New Tributary Types:
			- Foederatus Tributary
				- Like a permanent tributary, but (ai) will never refuse a call to arms
- Integrated Nezaros' Minority system and adapted it to WtWSMS
	- Added notion of minority capacity so an upper limit exists on the number of minorities in a county
	- Minorities can grow and decline in a cellular automaton style system
	- Specific cultural traditions and religious doctrines & tenets will interact with this system
	- Added new minority map modes to be able to see distribution of minorities on the map
	- Integrated with countil tasks
			- "Promote Culture" and "Convert County" tasks increase minority level by one (none -> small minority -> large minority -> majority)
			- By default, the tasks will continue until the majority of the county is changed
- Improved CCU model:
	- Languages:
		- Introduced notion of dialect continua to provide more granularity to languages
			- A language can have multiple continua, helping provide a better model for languages at the lowest levels
		- Introduce notion of creoles to allow genetically unrelated languages to have some degree of relation to each other
	- Heritages:
		- Allowed heritages to have multiple heritage groups and families, in line with the generally fuzzy notion of what a heritage is
		- Added "Kulturbund" concept to capture the relative heritage closeness of some heritages that are still distinct
			- Example: Altaic Kulturbund for Turkic and Mongolic heritage, Scythian Kulturbund for Sarmatian and Scythian heritages
- Added new title color system that colours tributary primary titles with their liege's primary title color
- Added basic religious mission task for Court Chaplains that allows independent rulers to launch conversion missions to other independent rulers with unreformed faiths
	- AI currently does not use this task as it is being balanced
- Implemented heritage and language drift events to model the evolution of culture and language during the period

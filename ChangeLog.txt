2025-MM-DD v0.1.8
-----------

Map and History:
- Changes to Germania:
   - De Jure Map:
      - Added Warini landed duchy in Mechklenberg and moved some counties from Werle and Angloland to it
   - Titular Title Changes:
      - Several former titular titles have been removed and converted to confederations, to better model the less-than-unified situation across much of the less politically organized portions of the map
         - 
      - Some titular titles have been made landed via effect in 476, then extended to confederations
         - This includes the Warini, which were becoming a force of note by the VIth century
         - Angles downgraded to Angloland duchy on map
      - Other titular tribal Germanic titles have been removed without a corresponding confederation
         - These include the Vidivarii, Denziner, Gustow

2025-07-29 v0.1.7.4
-----------
Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug with the Titular Roman Empires disintegrating regardless of capital's being held (slightly different).

2025-07-26 v0.1.7.3
-----------
Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug with the Titular Roman Empires disintegrating regardless of capital's being held.

2025-07-14 v0.1.7.2
-----------

Mechanics:
- Titular Roman Empires will be destroyed if one of the historic Roman Capitals for that title are not in the realm during succession
   - This models the very tenuous position Julius Nepos found himself in after the deposition of Romulus Augustulus
      - For the Western Roman Empire, holding one of Rome, Ravenna, Trier, or Milan will prevent this event
      - For the Eastern Roman Empire, holding one of Constantinople or Bithynia will prevent this event
      - For the Roman Empire, holding any of the six will prevent his event
- Permanent Tributaries are now generally accessible
   - They are created de facto next to Centralized Governments (i.e., Roman, Iranian, and Indian governments) during tributary creation
   - If not directly bordering the core polity, it instead becomes a vanilla tributary of the appropriate type

Casus Belli:
- Added Federate Border Raid CB
   - Models the occasionally contentious relationship between federates and Rome, especially with the Goths
   - Temporarily breaks tributary status and launches a raid war against a county of the suzerain
   - Victory also increases subsidies from suzerain, while defeat reduces subsidies
   - Requires one of "Fate of Iberia", "Legacy of Persia", "Roads to Power", or "Khans of the Steppe"

Cultures:
- Angle culture replaces "Warrior Culture" Tradition with "Hirds" Tradition
- Old Saxon culture replaces "The Witengamot" Tradition with "Hirds" Tradition
- Jute culture replaces "Coastal Warriors" Tradition with "Hirds" Tradition, regardless of DLC

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed generic tributaries not being able to fight for independence
- Blocked "Expand Duchy" and "Set De Jure Capital" decisions when primary titles are titular
- Fixed Elamite heritage being available on Culture Divergence

Localization:
- The Frankish kingdom is now localized as "Francia" instead of "The Franks", in line with other post-Roman Germanic states
- The Germanic religion is localized to "Germanic" for consistency

2025-07-05 v0.1.7.1
-----------
- Updated the mod to Vanilla 1.16.2.1

Mechanics:
- Added some new permanent tributary types for centralized governments (Roman, Persian, Indian)
   - One for Non-Tribal, Non-Nomadic and another for Nomadic and Tribal
   - Non-Tribal, Non-Nomadic adds tributary tax while tribal does not
   - These tributaries types are inherited, even after claimant wars
- Re-added Federates as a type of tributaries
   - Available only with "Khans of the Steppe" DLC
   - Both Suzerain and Tributary Guarantee laws are always on
   - Is creatable via interactions, like previous federate interactions
   - Federate Gains:
      - Receives subsidies from the suzerain, improving domain taxes
      - Improved levy size and reinforcement rate, Men-At-Arms cost and maintenance
      - Pays levies to the suzerain
   - Suzerain Gains:
      - Decreased Men-At-Arms cost and maintenance
      - Pays gold subsidies to the Federate, loosing capital development growth and domain taxes

Culture:
- Changed Cultures:
   - Punic: Gave it a new "Punic" heritage to distinguish the colonial Phoenician population from the Levantine population
   - Galatian: Changed to be an Anatolian heritage culture instead of a Continental Celtic heritage culture
- New Cultures:
   - Romano-Punic: Represents the Romanization of the relic Punic population in the Vth-IXth centuries, Roman/Punic hybrid
      - This is separate from Romano-African culture, with slightly different traditions

Casus Belli:
- Migration Wars:
   - Counties that convert to tribal holdings during Major Migrations now destroy all other holdings in the county
   - Modified Major Migrations to better match desired conversion of territories to Tribal holdings
   - Migration Wars are disabled within the Greate Steppe Situation region
      - Nomadic migration is instead used in that area
- Extended lowered required fame level CB requirements to WtWSMS Wars & the effect is compounded for traditions enabling easier migrations

Tweaks:
- Removed extraneous claims for Romulus and Beuka at the appropriate bookmarks
- Removed "Settle as Tribal" Decision, as it is superceded by Khans of the Steppe nomad mechanics

         - Odovacar also has a number of landless allies, simulating his role in ruling over the Western Roman Barbarian Military establishment
      - If Zeno looses his war, it becomes a game over
   - Added some landless missionaries
      - These cannot have a successor and will disappear when the current holder dies
      - Applies to Severinus of Noricum and Ajax of Suebia

      - The old landed Baguadae holder is now landless in Hispania
      - Added several additional Baguadae in Gaul, Armorica, and Hispania
- "Culture Blending" tradition now encourages adoption of the ruler's heritage and language, even without a conqueror culture tradition
- Removed previous Tributary mechanics in favor of direct vassal contracts
   - Previous mechanics had significant technical issues
   - Implemented a specific vassal contract for tributary like relations providing religious and title protection
   - Implementation is very shallow and not designed for player interaction

   - Applies currently to Major Migrations
- Migrations:
   - Major Migrations now cause reduction in development in counties, weighted by how many minorities the county has after migration
      - The larger the minority (or majority), the greater the damage
   - There is a chance that castle holdings of low development will be converted to tribal holdings during major migrations
      - This is mitigated by certain innovations, and some are very important to prevent this effect
      - This effect occurs after migratory damages are applied

              - If you can have this tax decree, your Chancellor, Steward, Marshall, and Spymaster must be from these vassals
              - It is always tyrannical to revoke Wuzurgan titles (scaling inversely with Secular Authority), but having a title revocation reason halves the tyranny

2024-04-27 v.0.1.5
-----------
General:
- Updated the mod to Vanilla 1.12.4

Defines & Game Rules:
- Added default game rule slowing hybrid and divergence
- Reduced a number of hard-coded defines, slowing the growth of cultural acceptance
- Added game rule restricting the creation of de jure titles if the ruler's primary title is titular; off by default and has an "AI only" variant as well.

New Mechanics:
- The Senate:
   - Created two Senate institutions, with Roman and Constantinopolitan Senates, instead of having them on the map as a title
   - The institution is interactable through the GUI as a new menu item
   - Senate Interactions:
      - Request Recognition:
         - An event fires several days after taking the Senate Seat, where the Consul requests that you request Senatorial recognition
         - You can Accept, Ignore the Senate, or Stall; all actions costing prestige and conferring modifiers
         - After that event, players may request through the GUI that the Senate recognize them if they chose to stall instead of making a decision
      - Rather than a decision, players may disestablish the Senate in the GUI if they are not a Roman-type culture or a Roman government
   - Senatorial Recognition:
      - Getting the recognition of the Senate confers a modifier which negates short-reign penalties, at the cost of prestige, but also gains an opinion bump with Senators
      - Ignoring the Senate gains one prestige at the cost of an opinion malus with Senators
      - Stalling the Senate hurts one's opinion with Senators, and each new consul will both the Senate Seat top liege, requesting that they seek the approval of the Senate
   - Senate Character Interactions:
      - The top liege of the Senate seat (Rome or Constantinople for East and West, respectively) and the consul may use Senate Interactions
      - They may nominate a new Senator from characters in the "Senatorial Regions" around the Senate Seats or within the top liege of the Senate Holder's realm
      - They may elevate dynasties to join the ranks of the senate
      - The top liege of the Senate Seat may also nominate the next consul
      - However, Senators react negatively to such interference by the top holder and such actions give negative opinion modifiers and cost variable prestige (depending on the nominee's traits and standing)
   - Senatorial Families:
      - Senatorial families have some implicit modifiers, granting prestige gain for dynasty members as well as bolstering diplomacy and intrigue
      - Senatorial families expect to have a certain number of non-capital (or capital) baronies in their family
      - Senatorial family dynasts will bother the holder of the Senate seat if their family has fewer holdings than desired
         - Accepting grants a random non-capital barony to the Senator's family at the cost of aggravating vassals
         - Refusing irritates the whole Senate
   - Traits and Modifiers:
      - Senators for both the East and West have traits which denote their membership and provide some prestige gain
      - The Consuls have a character modifier indicating their consulship
      - Previous Consuls have a trait indicating their prior consulship
      - These Traits have additional, culture-related modifiers
   - Senate leadership is elected yearly
      - The Senate will behave somewhat autonomously, electing Consuls every January, or sooner if the consul dies mid-term, from among their ranks
      - Players may nominate Consuls if they hold the Senate Seat, annoying the Senate but giving their nominee prestige and renown, as well as making them next consul
   - Senate and Title Revocation:
      - Revoking non-capital baronies from Senators _without a revocation_ reason angers all Senators
      - Applies even for bureaucratic and gubernatorial governments (who otherwise have very liberal revocation rules)
      - This does not extend to Senators with counties or greater
   - Either of the Senates may collapse if no senator is available to maintain the Senate's functions
   - Rajamandala and Eranshahr governments cannot request interact with the Senate, as they function under very different understanding of universality than the Roman Empire
   - Senatorial approval and disapproval comes with legitimacy gain and loss, modified by government type, held titles, and culture features
- Title Creation:
   - Titular Cultural Titles and related concepts removed
   - Holding only Titular Kingdoms or Empires prevents you from creating de jure kingdoms and empires
   - Added a decision for making titular Kingdoms into de jure Kingdoms for characters who cannot establish Roman empires, or for land outside the Roman Empire
      - Only available to non-tribal, non-nomad, non-Gubernatorial governments
      - Requirements:
        - Have held the duchy in which the capital county resides for at least 30 years
        - Complete control of at least two duchies within the same de jure kingdom, one of which is the capital duchy
        - The capital duchy is your culture and faith
        - Your culture has Social Stratification and Writing Innovations
        - Legitimacy Level of 3
        - Prestige Level of 5
        - Maximum Crown-Type Authority if government has it, or sufficient fedualization for Sub-Roman governments
   - Added a decision for replacing de jure Roman Provinces with titular Kingdoms for characters who can establish Roman empires, for land within the Roman Empire
      - Similar to the above, but requires complete control of the associated kingdom
      - Prestige prices increases quadratically with the degree of feudalization in the Realm
      - Also requires Legal Codex Innovation
   - Added a decision for making titular Empires de jure
   - Added a decision for making titular Roman Empires de jure

WtWSMS Mechanics, from Previous Releases:
- Minorities:
   - Faith Conversion (by event/decision/interface): a large minority of your old faith will still exist in your capital if you convert
   - Culture creation removes parent culture minorities in counties of the new culture
   - If a hybrid or diverged culture is within the cooldown period, the parent cultures are subsumed instead of becoming a minority when the county culture changes

Mechanics:
- Improved CCU model:
